4,"Hi!

Since I understood, that I have a game history (13th of June), I tried to play as best as possible in vintage tournament practice. I won 29 of the 31 games since then. I am very confused, because I thought, that the decks used there might have league status. But that cannot be - I play an own built BUG deck after having a break for almost 20 years.

8,"Hi, I'm pretty new to playing the Vintage scene, but I've been watching videos for a couple of years now. I mainly play Modern (where I play a variety of off-meta decks) and Legacy (where I play D&amp;T and Maverick). I've finally decided to get into Vintage with a semi-budget list that I'm hoping might measure up, at least some of the time. I'll be playing on MTGO, so price isn't as much of a concern. This is a very, *very* rough first draft of the deck. I'll be looking to refine it once or twice before even buying the cards I don't have. On to the list:

___

**Mana:**

4 Windswept Heath, 4 Flooded Strand - just fetches I already had. 

2 Tundra, 4 Savannah - the deck is mainly white, splashing blue and green, so the duals reflect that. Any fetch grabs any dual, fixing us perfectly.

4 Wasteland, 1 Strip Mine - the land destruction package. No surprises here.

1 Mox Emerald, 1 Mox Pearl, 1 Mox Sapphire - the Moxen in our colours. Running maindeck artifact hate means I'm loath to run the off-colour Moxen. 

**Mana creatures:**

4 [Elvish Spirit Guide](https://scryfall.com/card/me2/159/elvish-spirit-guide) - basically Moxen 4-7. It ramps out all but four of our creatures. If there was a blue version, we might be playing that too.

4 [Noble Hierarch](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/174/noble-hierarch) - our 1-mana dork. This might just be too slow for Vintage anyway, but it ramps out our bigger creatures, while again avoiding artifact hate.

**Hatebears:**

4 [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/36/thalia-guardian-of-thraben) - a mini Lodestone Golem. This comes down quick and taxes things, which gives us time to play out more hatebears and win. Currently this only has 7 (soon to be 3) things it taxes in our deck.

4 Lavinia, Azorius Renegade - four might be too many, but I really like Lavinia. She stops Workshop, Moxen, Lotus, Paradoxical Outcome, fast mana artifacts - all nasty, horrible cards like that that are all terribly unfair. ^^/s

2 [Containment Priest](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/11/containment-priest) - a hedge against Oath and Dredge. Stops Oath, Narcomoeba, Bloodghast and Prized Amalgam. 

2 [Ethersworn Canonist](https://scryfall.com/card/mma/14/ethersworn-canonist) - basically a bad Rule of Law. *Kind of* stops Storm. A big fat nothing against Shops. 

4 Phyrexian Revoker - so many activated abilities in Vintage. It even shuts off mana abilities of artifacts. It's good here for the same reasons it's good in Shops. 

3 [Spirit of the Labyrinth](https://scryfall.com/card/bng/27/spirit-of-the-labyrinth) - a great 3/1 beater that also stops cantrips, JTMS and Paradoxical Outcome. I'm not really sure how good it actually is, but I like it in Legacy well enough. It being an enchantment, making it vulnerable to Disenchant effects, is probably a big big downside.

2 [Gaddock Teeg](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/199/gaddock-teeg) - stops X spells from Shops, JTMS, Cruise, DTT, and maybe a few others I'm not remembering right now. Probably not as good as I think it will be, but I'd like to hear your opinions. 

3 [Thalia, Heretic Cathar](https://scryfall.com/card/emn/46/thalia-heretic-cathar) - turning all your opponent's nonbasics into taplands seems very good. Getting this out turn 1 off Moxen and ESG seems like a very strong start to the game. 

2 [Sanctum Prelate](https://scryfall.com/card/cn2/23/sanctum-prelate) - in Legacy, this is a very skill-testing card, in knowing what number to choose. I feel like Vintage having a much wider range of CMCs in a deck is going to make this a less obvious choice in each game, but I particularly look forward to naming 0 to hit Moxen and Lotus and 1 to hit cantrips.

Honorary hatebear mention - 4 Null Rod. These are going to be replaced by the new Collector Ouphe once MH1 is released. These get taxed by Thalia, making them quite a lot worse than Ouphe, but I'd still like to have them in the deck to improve the Shops matchup.

**Sideboard:**

4 Leyline of the Void - an awesome catch-all counter to Dredge. Nothing surprising. I like this a lot better than Tormod's Crypt.

4 Grafdigger's Cage - stops Dredge and Oath. 

4 [Serenity](https://scryfall.com/card/wth/24/serenity) - mainly there to wipe Shops' board. I feel like Shops and Eldrazi are likely to be our two worst matchups, and I like this to help stabilise against them.

3 Nature's Claim - destroys any Shops target. 

**Maybeboard:**

Black Lotus - you're probably surprised at the exclusion of Lotus in the maindeck. Honestly... I forgot about it. I know, I'm an idiot. Despite the Null Rods/Ouphes, I think exluding Lotus is just a bad choice. I'm not really sure what I'd cut for it though. 

Ancestral Recall - another card that gets taxed by Thalia seems unfortunate, but even through Thalia's tax, I feel Ancestral is just too good to not be playing. 

Time Walk - same reasoning as Ancestral.

Deathrite Shaman - with eight fetches and five Wasteland effects, I don't think we'll be lacking in fuel for DRS. I'd probably cut Hierarchs for it, and swap a Savannah for a Scrubland to make the most of DRS's burn effect. A lack of exalted and no guarantee it can make mana is holding me back from this change.

Leovold, Emissary of Trest - if I'm splashing black for DRS, I don't see any reason not to include Leovold too. Gives us some protection from removal. Speaking of...

Swords to Plowshares/Abrupt Decay/Assassin's Trophy/Path to Exile - removal! Like Lotus, I kind of forgot about it. I know it's not as important in Vintage as in other formats, because Vintage is more about spells, but at least *some* removal is probably better than none.

Library of Alexandria - I don't feel like this is a Library deck. We're unlikely to have seven cards in and after turn 1, unless we Ancestral, and cutting a coloured source for it feels bad to me.

Mental Misstep - is it just straight-up bad to not be playing Missteps? It gets taxed by Thalia, and I'm likely to lose any counter war. 

Basic Plains - I'm not sure if I need a basic to get around Back to Basics and Blood Moon. I've not really seen either with much regularity in my time watching Vintage, but I could be wrong. 

Force of Will - only 4 blue cards means I don't have the fuel for Force. Also rather out of budget for me. 

Sol Ring/Mana Crypt/Mana Vault - a distinct lack of generic costs and maindeck artifact hate seems like these just aren't worth it.

Gitaxian Probe - not sure if it's worth it to be playing any more noncreature spells, even if it basically cycles for free. 

Hurkyl's Recall - another anti-Shops card. Is this better than Serenity?

[Gaea's Herald](https://scryfall.com/card/10e/265/gaeas-herald) - probably the first time most of you have heard of this card. I know I hadn't until today. Seems good to protect you against all manner of blue decks, but not much else.

___

So that's the deck and my thoughts on it so far. I'm very interested in hearing your opinions, particularly on if this deck is even worth it. Please be as brutally honest as you can, I'd like this to be as good as possible before I take it into a league. Thanks!",Vintage
9,"The tech choices made by Vintage deckbuilders in the past are for their respective metagames. Further, restricted and ban lists also applied to these decks and those rule lists have changed over time.  But let's say that the top deckbuilders could see into the future and adopt their decks according to the future meta. And let's consider the question for the legal restricted/ban list at the snapshot times (5/10/15/20 years ago).  

Now let the top vintage decks from 5/10/15/20 years ago (with the corresponding tech &amp; sideboard modifications) face off against the decks from now. 

How do you think the winrate (WR) trend over time looks like for the 4 periods (5/10/15/20 years ago)?

21,"Hallo

after watching the Vintage Super League I was really hooked by the format. I have never seen so many insane and broken plays in games of magic. This really impressed me and I desire to enter the Vintage format and having some insane and enjoyable games for myself in paper. So far so good. The problem is that I neither own Power or 4 Bazaar of B. or 4 Workshops and to be honest I think I will never (or it took me several years) be able to afford that. So are any of the powered decks playable without power? I know that Eldrazi or some kind of mono red prision are my best options, but I don't want to play a deck without any of  the cool and flavorful vintage cards like Demonic Tutor, Mana Drain, Yawgmoth's Will and so on... And personally for me they don't have a touch of the vintage flavour and I can't enjoy playing one of these decks. I know that without power I will lose a good amount of percentage points, but I want to play the format, rather for fun than pure competiveness and as long I have game against the powered decks and don't losing every match in a row I am fine with that.

This are the most appealing decks to me and I think they aren't completly unplayable without Power:

A variant of Oath, Uw Landstill, Uwb Gush Mentor and any kind of Ubx/ Uwx Fish style decks.

So could any one of the mentioned decks function well without power, or are these just unplayable choices?

I thank you for your help!

22,"I was a big fan of the ""fish"" archetype when I was more heavily into vintage. There has been a bit of a resurgence in popularity of the format in my area and I was thinking about running something fishy with the typical mana denial package of null rod/stony silence + wastelands. I don't see those decks represented in the meta at all right now, with the possible exception of the BUG Leovold decks that don't even run Null Rod. Is Null Rod just an outdated strategy now? It seems like it would still be good against Shops (ravager in particular) and Paradoxical Storm. ",Vintage

35,"Hey /r/MTGVintage,

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate and I were discussing what we like about MTG, and trying to figure out how to make a cube that ""feels"" the way we want it to. The gist of it was we wanted to capture a lot of what Vintage ""feels"" like. Of course, there are powered cubes that include Power 9, but the issue/limitation we find with those is that it still ends up having a much different texture than Vintage. It's primarily that cards are singleton, but also just the way cube and its overall design culture has evolved has lead to decidedly ""non-Vintage"" things like aggro and superfriends being typically powerful strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm coming to you guys... not exactly sure what it is I'm trying to ask. I accidentally made [a fairly popular post on the general MTG reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/9uaiq5/what_is_the_most_powerful_feeling_magic_card_to/) yesterday, but I didn't really get the information I was looking for. What I'm trying to figure out is, what things do I need to do to ""distill"" the essence of Vintage? How do I make decks built from draft or sealed feel like a Vintage deck? How do I make sure cards that are good in Vintage are good in limited? Or, what are cards that feel like playing Vintage that can shine in an environment like cube?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are things I'm considering, in hopes of making a cube feel more like (constructed) Vintage:

**Duplicate copies of Moxen and a lot of the restricted cards.**

The logic behind this is a little unintuitive. Basically, in constructed Vintage decks, most players have more than one Mox in their deck. Looking at MTGGoldfish lists, it seems 3-5 is the common amount of original Moxen in a 60/75 card list. By having two of each of the WUBRG Mox, that leaves us with 10 to be drafted between \~8 players. You're still going to (on average) end up with comparatively less Moxen in your deck than a typical constructed Vintage deck. Being able to make the assumption that players 'incedentally' have tiny/free artifacts is pretty crucial to a lot of Vintage cards working.

**Having a bunch of copies of cards like Force of Will.**

If you're playing Vintage, you're playing Force of Will. I had the thought to include as many as eight copies of it in the cube, but that might be going a little too deep. Duplicates or multiples of other format staples seems like it would also help this cube ""feel"" more like Vintage than another cube.

**Borrowing from Legacy?**

One particular thought I had looking at my other post was ""Aluren might be a good fit?"" This is kind of divergent, I think, but possibly relevant for creating the mechanical feeling I'm going for. Basically, I was kind of surprised with the answers to my thread yesterday. Omniscience is a powerful card, and I get why it feels powerful. But--gosh dangit--it's a hugely expensive enchantment that still leaves me needing to ""cast"" cards from my hand! Aluren doesn't really fix any of the issues I have with omniscience, but it does do a fraction of what omniscience does and can be tremendously powerful. Aluren and Cloudstone Curio turns a lot creatures into combos. Does this sound like something worth exploring?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about all of this? Any ideas, any criticisms?",Vintage

I read this article years ago and RG's deck has stayed with me ever since. I just love this idea for a deck. In some sense, it's a control deck, but it not as fun-sapping or off-putting  as the standard counterspell/lockdown (like Orim's chant on a scepter.) It feel likes a joke, but in the best way, one that's fun for all players. I want to make something like this, but using real cards, no Unhinged or unglued. Also, I want to make it function decently well. I've tried googling around to see if anyone's already made decks similar to this, but I can't find any. I don't even know what to search really.  


 Does anyone know of any decks similar to this that they can link here or can anyone recommend any cards that would fit this theme?  


(To be more specific, cards that: introducing strange win conditions or modify the preexisting win condition, cause card swapping with the player, wager on coin flips or card flips, ""mini games,"" and ""equalizers"" or cards that render creatures useless.)

So, the question. How do I give myself a better tools to fight the Landstill/xerox/Bug decks. Or basically any deck packing force plus extra? I tried some antiquities wars in the board as more must answers that also can draw cards but when it can get pyroblast'd both on the way down and right before it turns your rocks into threats it makes the card feel less than stellar. The grids are good but only too a point and I understand that permanent based disruption ontop of countermagic is going to be hard to win against no matter what i try and do. I was just hoping for some advice on what to change in maybe the sideboard or cards that might be cut-able in the main to help fight the control matchups without taking away form the explosiveness of the main deck.",Vintage

53,"Some time ago, I became interested in playing Vintage from seeing how deep the lines of play were on VSL coverage. However, as you might have guessed by my name, I'm a huge fan of Infect, and I wasn't able to find any Infect viable lists, such as from MTGTop8 and such. As such, I made it my goal to brew something up, and this is what I developed.

Blazing Infect

Sideboard (15)  
3 Hurkyl’s Recall  
2 Jace, the Mind Sculptor  
3 Ravenous Trap  
4 Show and Tell  
3 Steel Sabotage

Of note are a few things:  
1) Blasphemous Act is in as a target for Mystical Tutor in order to make Blazing Shoal lethal.  
2) Glistener Elf is out because of Mental Misstep. Technically, the deck's combo is wholly resilient to Mental Misstep, and it usually is to Misdirection (assuming that they have no creatures on the battlefield as well.)  
3) Against decks with a fair amount of removal, such as StP, Abrupt Decay, etc., I can transform the deck by siding out the creatures and bringing in 4 Show and Tell and 2 JtMS.  
4) While I haven't experimented with mainboard Show and Tell in place of some number of Plague Stingers, I've been thinking that I should, as it would give me something to do should a boss monster get stuck in my hand aside from pitching it to Force of Will.

My name is Ethan or Donny as many of you probably know me from around discord. I am hosting a vintage competition free of charge on the platform untap.in.

For those of you who do not know vintage is a format where the power 9 is played. However, to control the insane power of these cards they and other powerful cards are restricted to a one of.

Anyways this format contains decks for every type of player. The aggro player would play shops , The combo player would play storm or dredge, The control player would play sandstill, and the midrange player would play a mentor list. This is just a example of the typical meta, brewers also are discovering this format as spicy lists come out all the time. (See more decklists at https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/vintage#paper)

The UOL is a discord community centered around magic and playing on untap.in. In order to avoid the random scene on the site the community provides different events and lfg groups to help facilitate competitive gameplay. On July 7th the UOL will be hosting this vintage open. After signing up the first set of pairings will go up at 11:00 am (est) and each round will follow after 50 minutes respectively. The majority of the open will be played in the swiss with a cut to top x depending on the amount of participants we have sign up. For further questions you can contact me or read the system of [rules](https://goo.gl/FLK3LY) the UOL has set in place for events, thanks for playing!

&amp;nbsp;

Now I know the vintage format can be limited in its big fans but when price isn’t an issue vintage is a fun format for all to try! With this being noted I decided to grab a few sample lists for you all to look at and maybe test off of to help provide some context for how the format plays out. The 3 broad categories in vintage include **Dredge**, **Shops** and **Blue Decks**. **Blue decks** includes several different varieties of lists from storm to oath combo and control decks using mana drain to their advantage. **Shops** is an artifact based deck looking to stop its opponents from playing long enough for it to finish them off. **Dredge** is looking to mill its’ library to enable Dread Return kills or Bridge from Below shenanigans. It’s typically said that **Shops** will beat **Blue Decks** but lose to **Dredge**, while **Dredge** loses to the **Blue Decks** in the format. While not all games or lists fall into these scenarios, this gives a decent overview of what to expect from a tiered match of vintage. I’ll wish you luck in the open and leave you with these sample lists to start. Have fun and good luck!

I tried to find some article how to play (and most importantly how to sideboard) with this specific Dredge version or at least with Dredge in general, but I failed, is there anything like that? I am a reasonably good mtg player and a VSL fan, so I think I understand the deck on the surface level, but especially what to cut postboard and why is a mystery to me.

Also, how crucial is Unmask? It does not seem that important to me, but I suspect I may be very wrong.",Vintage

65,"It’s certainly the one that saw the least tournament play, since it was only legal for a few weeks.

[Deck reference](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Extended_Broken_Jar_deck)

The thing that bugs me is that even though it won pretty consistently on turn 1 “through countermagic,” that was only in Standard and Extended as far as I can tell. Powerful combo decks that beat Force-of-Will-powered The Decks already existed in Vintage, like Prosperity/Academy combo, but even that lost to Necro in the 1999 Duelist Invitational (and again in Randy Beuhler’s Gauntlet of Greatness, although Jar ended up winning convincingly).

So is Jar that much better than anything else that’s ever existed? Did it deserve an emergency ban in Vintage as well as the other formats? Can other decks adapt to a meta with Jar? Or is it more format-warping than the recent iteration of Shops when Lodestone Golem was unrestricted? And how would it fare against Shops, with or without Null Rods?",Vintage

EVENT SCHEDULE

Starting Saturday July 21, 12am CDT (10pm PDT)

The day after each round is complete, I will announce pairings for the next round. Pairings will follow the normal Swiss method (similar win/loss records paired together avoiding repeats).

Format: Historical Vintage

Explanation: 

* Choose a B&amp;R list from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ot6luHsleTzizfuB0zuXem-BG9Hh0-97weXctqdkGiQ/edit?usp=sharing
* Build your deck using that B&amp;R list
* Other than B&amp;R list, decks should follow the normal rules for Vintage deckbuilding (60-card minimum, max 4 copies of a card, etc).

Location: Play Lobby &gt; Constructed Open Play &gt; Tournament Practice 

* Format: Freeform
* Match Options: 2 Wins, 25 Minutes

Entry: free

Number of Players: 4+

Structure: Swiss rounds

Additional: (This is the part I really need critical eyes on) Because of the nature of this format, and because this is an unofficial tournament, we need a few additional requirements to ensure fair play (and for viewer entertainment):

* Decklists will be made public. This ensures players are entering legal decklists for their chosen ban lists.
* Each player must record their matches and post the recordings online. Your entire deck and sideboard must be visible during sideboarding (I intend to check each player's decklists during sideboarding to ensure they are following their own ban lists). The output must be 1080p. You can post match results and links to the recordings in the comments for the reddit post, or by emailing me at the address I post later.
* * You can use the newest version of OBS to record in 1080p. OBS is available here: https://obsproject.com/download
* * * To get 1080p, use the recording quality presets under Settings &gt; Output &gt; Simple mode. Under Recording options, choose ""Indistinguishable Quality, Large File Size""
* * You can upload videos to Youtube. Twitch or other streams are also acceptable, provided your deck and sideboard are visible during sideboarding.
* If your opponent provides a quality match video and you don't, you will lose the match.
* After pairings are released, players schedule their own matches with their opponents. It doesn't matter when you schedule your match, but you have 48 hours fromt he time pairings are released to upload the results of your match.
* If match results aren't reported within 48 hours, it will be counted as a tie.

PRIZES

* 1st Mox Sapphire VMA
* 2nd Mox Ruby VMA
* 3rd-4th Mishra's Workshop ME4
* 5th-8th Ancestral Recall VMA

Players can choose a prize lower on the list than their rank would otherwise indicate.

REGISTRATION

Registration will be open until July 21, midnight CDT (10 PM PDT)

Round 1 starts July 21 at noon CDT.

To register, post your name, MTGO handle, ban list (Year and Month), and decklist in [a form or Google doc that I post later].",Vintage

This is my first time messing around with Vintage. I tried going back to my roots since I first started Magic a few years ago with black (and green). I've always been fascinated by mill decks and I love being able to make combos with cards whenever I can. I also love trying to challenge myself by forcing myself to try to make decks that I'm not used to. This time i wanted to make a creatureless deck. I have only played around with this deck on untap.in and I technically don't own the physical cards yet. I just want to know if I should replace Bubbling Muck with Dark Rituals before I go buying any cards. And I do know I'm missing a lot of the vintage staples, but that is only because my friends and I usually can't afford all of the really pricey cards, and we are definitely really casual so it's not like we're missing out on anything. 

Sidenote: The maybeboard is a complete mess. Mainly because I was originally making it Red/black, but then I realized that red was unnecessary. ",Vintage

E.g. I might play [the Meandeck Oath list from this link](http://www.eternalcentral.com/schools-of-magic-the-history-of-vintage-a-starcitygames-power-nine-series-retrospective/), using the B&amp;R list from September 2004, but:

86,"After reading [Stephen Menendian's history of the SCG Power 9 series](http://www.eternalcentral.com/schools-of-magic-the-history-of-vintage-a-starcitygames-power-nine-series-retrospective/), I got interested in these old decks and wondered how they'd do today. And I was inspired by [Randy Beuhler's Gauntlet of Greatness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loqpIczKcTo). So I was thinking: what if someone could organize something like that, except getting the experts play their own decks, like the time Randy got Raphael Levy to play his Loam Pox deck?

Personally, I'd love to see e.g. Rich Shay playing Control Slaver against LSV(?) playing Mentor (with 4 copies of the namesake card), or Kevin Cron playing TriniStax against Eric Becker playing Pitch Long, or Shuhei Nakamura/Brian Kelley playing Oath against Andy Probasco playing Painter Gush. But what kind of prize support would incentivize those experts of old decks to play in a tournament, or even a league? And what for good commentators? And what would even be the right way to choose decks (assuming enough people were interested)? 

After watching the Gauntlet, I think limiting decklists to what we saw in the past is the wrong approach - sideboards and even mainboards should be allowed to shape to a new meta. So it would seem to me that the right thing to do would be to allow any submission for a archetype that uses the card pool and ban list from a certain era. Or would it be better with the modern card pool? Forcing people to use Darksteels when Blightsteels are available just seems wrong.

Also, MTGO or paper? And if paper, by webcam or in person?

This is kindof just a dream of mine right now. But I think it would be awesome. I'd love to see how the bans affected the power level and play of these decks against those that took their places, and how deck-building and the card pool evolved over time. And it could be a great way to get some perspective on the vintage restricted list.

The top 8 is based on single-elimination of the top 8 after 6 rounds of swiss pairings, while 9 through 32 is based on standings after the swiss rounds.   
  
Here’s a comparison of the top 32 metagame this week compared to last week’s (in parentheses):  
  
Blue Control: 13 (6)  
Shops : 9 (12)  
Oath: 3 (8)  
Dredge: 5 (4)  
Combo: 2 (2)  
  
Compared to last week we see that Blue control decks traded metagame share with the Oath decks while the shops decks stayed somewhat the same. In fact, there were 6 Monastery Mentor lists this week compared to zero last week. Without knowing the full metagame, to me this points to a general preparedness for Oath after last week’s strong performance, since blue control decks generally have a good Oath matchup. I’m  actually a bit surprised that Workshop decks didn’t do better, since they traded one of their worst matchups for a better one. This is just based off a glance, but my guess is that the blue decks are adapting to fight Shops decks a little harder. In the blue decks there were a lot of copies of cards like Stoney Silence, Kolaghan’s Command, Abrade, Balance, and Hurkyll’s Recall all in the mainboard, not to mention By Force, Energy Flux, sweepers, etc. in the sideboards. I even spotted copies of Daretti, Ingenious Iconoclast and Subterranean Tremors. We've seen some weeks with pretty big shifts in the online challenge metagame (at least, the top 32), and this week was no different.  
  
On a related note, I like to look at how people may or may not be changing to fight the meta and how that seems to work out for them. 13 players who made the top 32 last week made the top 32 again this week. 10 of those players played the same archetype both weeks. There didn’t seem to be much of a trend for the Shops players; some did better, some did worse, some stayed about the same. For both of the players that stuck with Oath decks, however, performances in the top 8 last week were replaced with 22nd and 32nd, supporting the narrative that people came prepared for Oath after last week’s strong showing. The blue control players both had much better showings along with the lone repeat Dredge player, and I’ll note that SATURN once again had a great 4th place finish with his Aperture Science deck.  
  
JAZZA: Ravager Shops (11) --&gt; Ravager Shops (7)  
PASCAL3000: Ravager Shops (23) --&gt; Ravager Shops (14)  
SKNERUSMCKWACZ: Ravager Shops (18) --&gt; Ravager Shops (19)  
NOMOREHAWKS: Aggro Shops (3) --&gt; Aggro Shops (23)  
PSIVEN: Inferno Oath (5) --&gt; Inferno Oath (22)  
BLINKMOTH-NEXUS: Inferno Oath (15) --&gt; Inferno Oath (32)

SATURN: Aperture Science (4) --&gt; Aperture Science (4)  
EREXUS: Pitch Dredge (26) --&gt; Pitch Dredge (11)  
  
3 players decided to switch it up this week, and it seems to have worked out well for all of them. BADBRIAN moved from 7th with Shops to 2nd with Grixis Control, CALL1ME1DRAGON moved from 32nd with Dredge to 13th with P.O. Storm, and DOCTOR_WYRM moved from 2nd with Oath to 18th with Esper Mentor. While that last one wasn’t strictly an improved performance, considering  that 18th place is higher than any of the Oath results this week it seems that moving from Oath to another deck might have still paid off.  
  
BADBRIAN: Aggro Shops (7) --&gt; Grixis Control (2)  
CALL1ME1DRAGON: Pitch Dredge (32) --&gt; P.O. Storm (13)  
DOCTOR_WYRM: Inferno Oath (2) --&gt; Esper Mentor (18)  
  
Some last minute points:

96,"This is in response to the So Many Insane Plays episode ""Eternal Weekend In Review."" In it, Steve was talking about the arguments against restricting Shops, especially the one about blue mages complaining about shops. It stuck out to me that the arguments Steve made about how every deck that plays colored mana can and wants to play blue actually undermine his argument: if everyone that isn't playing Shops plays blue, then everyone who wants restrictions to shops is a blue mage complaining about shops.

But I got the impression that there was something inherently obvious to both Steve and Kevin that would actually refute that argument, and which they didn't say. In other words, that playing blue has no impact on your matchup against shops, neither strengthening nor weakening it*.

I imagine that's a common misconception, because even though I know Oath is a blue deck with a good matchup against shops, it's not obvious to me that playing blue is entirely disconnected from your matchup against shops - or even why Oath is so good against it. As a casual dredge enthusiast, I don't really understand the different blue matchups against Shops. It seems obvious that turbo xerox is the archetype that has the worst matchup against shops, but what blue decks don't care about shops, and what blue decks are good against shops?

And what does ""shops"" mean specifically in this broad sense? Taxing, fast mana, or Smokestacks? I'm partially joking of course, but clearly the version that recently won Eternal Weekend with Walking Ballista and Steel Overseer is a far cry from the original version that had Smokestack and no win-cons aside from Goblin Welder**. So my question here is: what makes up ""shops,"" and what makes a deck good, bad, or neutral against it?

I emailed my thoughts and questions to the somanyinsaneplays email a couple months ago, but never heard back, nor have they made an episode since then. I think it would be great if they did a podcast episode on the shops matchup. If they really nailed down what makes a (blue) deck weak, neutral, or resilient to sphere effects, it would be sweet to listen to. And I think it would help me learn deck construction, sideboarding, and which cards matter during the game. And it’d be helpful not only in Vintage, but in every format where spheres are an important part of the metagame, including competitive multiplayer EDH.

What do yall think? Would you want to hear that episode too? Other thoughts?

•Tier 1.5 or higher, I'm looking for something proven to hold its own, full proxy means I don't need to run a budget homebrew.

•Less than $800 on MTGO, I'll be getting 90% of my practice in online, this is a pretty hard ceiling on what I can get with current tix, scrapping spare decks and throwing extra cash in. I currently don't have any plans to buy into paper Vintage so the paper price of the deck doesn't matter. 

Other than that pretty much anything goes, I've got a fair amount of experience in Legacy and Modern so should be able to wrap my head around most deck decision trees.

A while back, Brian Kelly (Who I was fortunate enough to meet on Cockatrice, and he graciously taught me most of what I know before he moved to MTGO) set me up with a pretty spicy Oath list pre-restrictions, and it was fun, but it wasn't the same feeling.

I'm kind of reeling as I try to find my place again, having tried DP and PO storm, Blue Belcher, and other blue decks like Drain Tendrils, Steel City Vault etc. I just can't get comfortable in the new landscape of Vintage. 

No, I don't enjoy Shops, at least not anymore since it got more aggro. Dredge bores me to tears and is high variance, relying on people to not be prepared for it.

Yes, I'm aware of mtggoldfish, mtgtop8, tons of stuff there. But the deck lists don't seem to have any write-ups or descriptions with it. It's just a deck list, and as a noobie, I'd like to see an explanation of what each card is *for* and why it was picked.

tappedout isn't so great. A lot of people just posting random stuff...explanations and descriptions of their decks/brews, which is cool, but the decks posted aren't too great

I find vintage articles and write-ups to be kind of hard to find...I love rogue decks and unique deck ideas, but resources in general seem to be kind of lacking",Vintage
122,"Been taking a look at playing vintage. I love the idea of playing anything in magics history. I love p9, i love the literally endless possibilities.

The problem is, i dont wanna be competitive, but winning would be nice. Im not expecting to win huge tournaments or anything. Im just gonna stick to casually playing and maybe some cockatrice. but do homebrews at least have a chance of winning? Vintage has a preconception of being extremely fast and big, but ive also heard stories of jank winning with the right build/pilot...thoughts on that?

Also where can i find articles on deckbuilding and/or brewing? Ive seen a few Vintage 101 type articles. They all discuss archetypes and stuff but i wanna learn more about how to construct proper mana bases and maximizing my jank and brews with the right support cards.

As a side question, tell me about off color moxes...in vintage you obviously always want to run moxes and lotus, and as i understand, p9 and blue is pretty much always required (right?)...but does it make sense to run off color moxes? Its fast mana, but would i be better off with just running a proper land?",Vintage

127,"This is a topic I've put a little thought into, and realized I'd want the opinions of people more expert than I am. When bannings come around, I like anyone else am happy enough to see the same old boring decks rotate out and new decks rotate in. But I know that unlike most competitive players, I prefer trying new things to mastering a skill, and that some people really do enjoy increasing their skill with the same thing (see also: Chess, Go, etc). So while I might enjoy seeing new things, I shouldn't force my opinions on the people who actually play the game. So now onto the main point.

I've heard the words ""healthy metagame"" used in the past.

In particular, Modern is known to have a healthy metagame, because there are a wide variety of decks you can play. And Stoneblade-era Standard was a toxic metagame, because there was one best deck and people fled the game.

So ok, I get what a healthy metagame is, and why it affects Standard.

And when it comes to Standard, it makes sense why WotC bans cards. Standard is the format WotC supports the most, the format where it makes the most money, and the format new players tend to join (because that's what's available). And WotC needs to turn a profit, so when players stop buying into the game, they ban cards until the metagame changes and people join again. We saw that happen in the Affinity-era and Stoneblade-era, and to some extent in the CoCo-era. We're definitely seeing it now, jeez, there's been a lot of bans.

But eternal formats are different: no one expects new players to start with eternal formats (more the opposite: I think we generally expect people to start only after the cards they already bought rotate out of Standard), WotC doesn't support these formats as much, and they're largely driven by the secondary market.

And I've heard competitive players constantly say: if the best deck is X, then if you want to win then you've got to play X. So it seems to me like the competitive mindset makes no allowance for which or how many viable decks there are in a metagame.

Along the same lines, my understanding is that a ""healthy"" metagame can cause problems too: Eric Froelich said (in a Constructed Resources episode, which I'll paraphrase) that in Modern, unlike in Standard, you can't sideboard effectively because there are so many decks that hit you from so many different angles that you can't cover all of them. My more competitively-minded friends have made the even-more-pointed statement that Modern is not a competitive format. 

Whether you agree or disagree with that, I think it's clear that in a format with a huge variety of viable decks and win-cons, you can't defend against every strategy, and you'll lose some matches if you're unlucky enough to be paired up against them.

So, it seems to me like the most competitive metas are metas where there are no bannings, and once the best decks rise to the top, people play those decks without meta-interference.

And yes, I'm aware of how broken Vintage in particular would be if that were the case. I, like I guess many other people, have built a Turbo-Turns deck on Shandalar, which almost always won on turn 1 by casting some number of moxen/lotuses into Timetwister/Wheel until I got Time Walk, then repeating it every turn and defeating my opponent at my leisure. Although it's worth noting Force of Will doesn't exist on Shandalar (at least, not the basic version). But I digress.

I've heard the coin-flip argument too. It goes roughly: if every game is decided by the coin flip, you have a problem. And I can accept that: we all play the game because we want to actually play the game, usually by interacting with our opponents (or our own deck) enough to prove that we beat them with skill, not luck. And (in a more extreme example) giving everyone the 20-Wheel of Fortune/19-Black Lotus/1-Feldon Cane deck essentially turns every game into a coin flip.

But I've never seen that happen. 

When I started in Affinity-era Mirrodin, the 5 artifact lands and Skullclamp were banned not because every game was a coinflip and there was no interaction, but because Standard had become a 2-deck format: Affinity, and the decks designed to beat Affinity, e.g. Astral Slide. And people stopped playing (again, Standard).

When I started Vintage, I saw Trinisphere restricted. And that restriction was debatable even at that time. And since then, I've only seen bannings because decks are dominant or popular opinion went against a card, not because the game was reduced to Lotus/Wheel/Cane, or even because it was necessarily heading in that direction.

The biggest examples of this, to me, are the recent bannings in every eternal format: Gush, Top, Grave-Troll, etc. Of these, only Top sticks out in my mind as part of an actually dominant deck, seeing how MTGTop8 consistently showed Miracles at something like 273 decklists, compared with the next-highest deck having about 80 decks. Now I know Miracles was a powerful deck that could shut opponents out of the game and had resilient defenses, but were games against Miracles really just decided by coinflips? Or is it closer to the truth that Top was banned just because people wanted something different in Legacy?

I've heard Keith Burgun (Clockwork Game Design podcast) talk about how Magic is a shallow game because after learning for a while, you get bored of it, just like if you were playing with a toy. In other words, once you've explored it completely, there's nothing else to do, as opposed to strategy games, where the more you explore, the more there is to learn. 

Now I don't completely agree with that, and there's probably actually a spectrum from complete toy to complete strategy game. But I have heard pros like Marshall Sutcliffe talk about how he does get bored of the same format after awhile (he was talking about Limited, but the same point applies). And the recent bannings seem support Keith's claim. So is Magic in fact a toy, and the only way people have fun is by banning cards to force rotations?

tl/dr: Is it actually a bad thing to have a 1-deck format in eternal formats? If so, why?",Vintage

130,"Last week, I made a ['What's the Play?' post for a Time Vault combo deck](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGVintage/comments/6lel8r/whats_the_play/). This week, I wanted to try again with my favorite tribe, goblins. While not as popular of a deck in vintage as in legacy (where it's fallen out of popularity, so that's saying something...), goblins can be a grindy prison deck that leverages Cavern of Souls, Null Rod, and lots of goblin synergy to be competitive. Try and see if you can make the best play from the starting point below!
  
**What's the play?**  

It's game one and your opponent is on shops with 20 life, two cards in hand, and the following cards on board:

* Mishra's Factory
* Mishra's Workshop
* Mox Jet
* Phyrexian Revoker naming Krenko, Mob Boss
* Foundry Inspector
* Tangle Wire with 4 counters. 

They begin their turn by removing a counter from Tangle Wire and tapping Phyrexian Revoker, Foundry Inspector, and Tangle Wire. After drawing a card, they play another Mishra's Factory, cast Wurmcoil Engine and pass the turn.

You begin your turn at 19 life with the following cards in play:

* Mountain
* Mountain
* Cavern of Souls
* Skirk Prospector
* Goblin Piledriver
* Goblin Warchief

And the following cards in hand:

* Stingscourger
* Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker
* Goblin Matron
* Bloodstained Mire

You tap the Skirk Prospector, Goblin Piledriver, and Goblin Warchief for the Tangle wire and draw a Goblin Lackey. 

What do you do? [Here's your decklist](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/697203#paper) and you have zero goblins in the graveyard.",Vintage
131,"One of the things that I love about Vintage is the ability to make some crazy plays. With that in mind, I wanted to try my hand at one of those ""what's the play"" riddles. Unfortunately, I don't think this sub has any spoiler CSS (where you can have a black bar over the comment text that is revealed on mouseover), so try to answer before looking through the comments! 
  
**What's the play?**  
  
Your opponent is on the play and mulliganed to 5 cards. They start their first turn by casting Gitaxian Probe and see your hand of:  
  
* Island
* Mox Sapphire
* Mox Jet
* Mana Drain
* Trinket Mage
* Demonic Tutor
* Time Vault
  
Seeing that the coast is clear, the opponent plays an Island and casts Mox Jet, tapping it to play Sol Ring. Using the mana from the Island and the Sol Ring, they Tinker for Blightsteel Colossus, sacrificing the Mox Jet. The opponent then passes the turn.
  
You draw a Force of Will (they always show up after you need them!) and enter your first main phase.  
  
What do you do?

132,"There hasn't been a post in here in a while, so I figured I'd get one going. Like the title says, **what is your favorite deck, and why?**

If anyone follows my YouTube channel or my post history here or in the Facebook group, it's not a surprise that my favorite deck is Merfolk. 

* It is a blue deck that easily runs Force of Will, Mental Misstep, Flusterstorm, Mindbreak Trap, etc. So it doesn't just lose to the powerful things that often happen in Vintage, like turn 1 Belcher or Tinker for Blightsteel Colossus. 
* Null Rod sometimes wins games on its own.
* It wins through creature combat. Maybe it's because I started really playing semi-competitive magic in Modern, but I like turning creatures sideways. 
* Speaking of other formats, i like that Merfolk is a deck I can (and do) play in Modern and Legacy as well. 
* There aren't very many free wins (excluding null rod). Almost every game is very interactive and won based on decisions made regarding what to counter, what to wasteland, how to commit to the board, etc. There aren't any individually super-broken cards like Mentor or Lodestone Golem, and there isn't really great draw engine in the deck, so you can't waste resources.
* There's something fun about playing an underrepresented deck. Is the deck as good as Mentor, Shops, or Dredge? Probably not, but the great thing about Vintage is that as long as your deck has a certain power level and you play it well, you can be competitive.",Vintage

Within the Oath archetype there are many sub-archetypes. This is where I am hung up. Saheeli Oath seems to be the leading build. There's Fenton Oath, Burning Oath, Bomber Oath, Punishing Oath, etc. 

Is one version of Oath ""strictly better""? Not being familiar with the format it is tough to evaluate different builds in the current meta.

Questions:

1. Was your deck affected?

2. Please provide your prediction on how the meta will change.

3. IFF your deck was not directly affected how are you changing the main deck and the Side Board to adapt?

4. What is the overall direction of vintage?

Response (Bullet Format; Paragraph format if it suits your response):

1. My deck, [Oath of Druids Control / Combo](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/vtg-oath-control-variant/), was not directly affected 

2. I predict an uptick in dredge. I expect dredge to be approximately +5% [OR] +10% in any given meta. [[Paradoxical Outcome]] storm and Jeskai Mentor were the two decks that were faster and more consistent than dredge. I predict a down tick in Shops deck because they were preying on the land light builds of [[Paradoxical Outcome]]. Sphere effects are now not the top choice for disruption.
 
3. I changed the SB by removing four pieces of Mentor hate in 2 [[Dread of Night]], 1 [[Engineered Plague]], and 1 [[Merchant Scroll]]. I added 2 [[Faerie Macabre]] and 2 [[Tormod's Crypt]] in order to ice out dredge. 

4. I thing the overal direction of vintage is to have decks with a bunch of 1 ofs becuase everytime something becomes degenerate they will restrict it. IFF Oath of Druids becomes a meta warping I wuld not be surprised to see them Restrict oath of druids. There are no sacred cows anymore.

Note half the deck is not real and it's extremely unlikely that I will ever get to play a real t1 event or even own power.

That said this is mostly casual home tournament environment, now on to a few things.

I feel gas is a problem sometimes, I almost want more Jace than sfm and tnn.

Half the power is useless and library is only good if I stall for a couple turns and they have nothing, thinking of switching to Bazaar for better card draw utility and to power up the delve and scm.

Sofaf is there because I don't have UJ, sofai or another bskull. But it's utility is good for the untap, and discard is always good in small numbers for my group.

Sowap can end games quick and give life back but obviously sofai is the obvious best sword.

I do have a sobam but I'm not sure if the body is relevant and the mill is all but useless.

Ideally I'd run 2 bskull and 1 UJ/sofai but the untap from sofaf is nice if I have to move equipment around or hard cast a fow.

Been really enjoying this list immensely, I'm a sucker for UW control decks in all their forms and this one has it all really. Maindeck Fragmentize and Stony Silence have been great in general 

Round 1
Beer: Pussy Wagon, an IPA. One of my favorite IPAs, on the sweeter/fruitier end. Probably their best beer for laidback day drinking. 
Opponent: Bye, drove 35 minutes to get the bye round 1, drat. So I just spent the rest of the time chilling and watching everyone play their matches (spending most of it watching a match between Shops and a port of the BG turbo depths deck from legacy)

Round 2
Beer: Cali Green, also an IPA (Brash makes lots of those). Similar to Pussy Wagon but more bitter/hopier. It was also kegged not 3 days prior so it was super good.
Opponent: Sam on 2 Card Monte 

Super good MU imo, with maindeck Fragmentize and Stony Silence, I feel pretty confidant in the MU overall. Can have explosive starts (or randomly take a Mentor with helm, which has happened) however

Games played out about how I expect, game 1 I missteped and forced his key spells and enabler and let dack take over the game, and more or less the same thing happened game 2 (except I untapped with Mentor instead of dack).

Round 3
Beer: Milk The Venom, nominally a milk stout but this one has had all kinds of things added to it (coconut, chipotle, etc). I like it but it has a little too much going on, although this time I tried it, I tasted mostly cocunut, which was good. Admittedly, I was a little buzzed by now.
Opponent: Patrick on Shops 

 Not a bad MU I feel, but very hand dependent. I have tools to beat them, an early stony silence cripples their most explosive starts and is great against their grindier cards, and maindeck Fragmentize plus swords can be enough to stem the bleeding until Mentor lands. However, they can just simply lock me out of the game and not much I can do.

Again, the games played out about how I expect really. Sadly I lost the way I expect, but it happens. 

Round 4 
Beer: Smoglifter, the smoother of the two stouts they offered that day. I liked it less than Milk the Venom (and as probably the only one of the group that day with that opinion), still good. That said, given I'm a bit tipsy, it's possible my palette was distorted by this point.
Opponent: Chad on Shops

AGAIN GOD FUCKING DAMMIT ALL TO HELL

So I played shops again, which again happens. Similar to the last round but he hits me with a crucible and stripmine game 2, which tickles me in ways I can't go into detail about. Also unlike the last round I managed to win after he keeps an incredibly greedy keep (Fragmentize'd his moxen and never plays a land)

3-1, 5-3 in games, good enough for 3rd place and $15 cash. 

Overall, it was a blast, if you're in Houston, you should definitely try and make it out

As for my deck, at this point I feel I've played the deck enough to where I can tinker with it without making completely terrible decisions. I'm thinking of cutting the maindeck mindbreak trap, locally my meta has a lot of shops and Oath, neither of which Mindbreak Trap is particularly good against imo. In all the games, I cut it post-board and looking elsewhere, I think I'd rather move some number to my board and put a second fragmentize maindeck, and maybe a third dack in the main. The meddling Mage should be a flusterstorm or a second containment priest for sure.

The cards im owning is fetches, UGs and a tundra (I play DnT in legacy) and most of the commons and it will be in a big buy at the end of the month. So what im missing is essentially power which will take some time to gather and foW. Ill buy around 1 piece of power every second month at the most because money, any budget options?

Here is essentially the list im building http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=14352&amp;d=285730&amp;f=VI",Vintage
153,"Hello all, I'm a long time Legacy player who has finally gotten the last pieces of power 9 after the slow collection process that took the majority of my lifetime. 


The vintage meta-game has changed a fair bit recently and I was hoping to get some opinions on archetypes and specific card choices from experienced players.

---------------------------------------------------

**[MUD/Shops](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/23-02-17-Fha-mud/)** - 

This deck has changed a lot recently. I was initially thinking the deck would get considerably worse with the restriction of  [Chalice of the Void](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Chalice+of+the+Void&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) and [Lodestone Golem](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Lodestone+Golem&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname). With the printing of [Walking Ballista](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Walking+Ballista&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), [Hangarback Walker](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Hangarback+Walker&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), and [Foundry Inspector](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Foundry+Inspector&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), it's still appears to be one of the best decks in vintage. 

This version requires [Arcbound Ravager](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Arcbound+Ravager&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) and seems a bit more aggressive than it's older Stax variation.

I've seen a few versions running [Steel Overseer](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Steel+Overseer&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname). It seems decent in the deck, but I'm not convinced that it's worth taking up slots. Do any of you have more experience running this?

I've always enjoyed this style of play with prison/taxing effects. However, I still need to get a single [Mishra's Workshop](http://magiccards.info/aq/en/70.html) as well as a few other newer cards to build this up. 

A slightly cheaper option for me would be the **[Eldrazi Aggro](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/vintage-w-32726#online)** deck that runs [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname). I have not played with or against the deck, but on paper it seems like a slightly worse version of the MUD/Shops deck. However, I'd definitely consider it. 

---------------------------------------------------

**[Monastery Mentor Control](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/555814#online)** -

There appears to be a lot of variety in this archetype and I haven't put together my own list yet.  Some decks are spashing red, some black. I've even seen a couple running [Paradoxical Outcome](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Paradoxical+Outcome&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) which is pretty interesting. I'm leaning towards the red splash for [Dack Fayden](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Dack+Fayden&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname).

Another control archetype I'm considering is **[Landstill](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/572477#online)**. This deck has been around for a long time so I'm definitely more familiar with it.

Do you have any suggestions for card choices for either deck? Or even which deck you prefer? I tend to prefer hard control decks, but Mentor seems oppressively good and appears to have more play against many of the other top decks in vintage.

---------------------------------------------------

**[Paradoxical Storm](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/13-02-17-paradoxical-storm/)** -

I've always enjoyed playing storm decks, and [Paradoxical Outcome](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Paradoxical+Outcome&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) has lead to a storm deck that is less dependent on black. Being able to run [Force of Will](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Force+of+Will&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) in a storm deck is pretty much living the dream, and the reason I picked up the last couple pieces of power that I needed.

My biggest concern is that Paradoxical Outcome will be restricted. The deck doesn't appear to be dominating, but perhaps some of you can comment on whether or not the deck might stick around.

The only other combo deck I'd consider is **[Dredge](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/558743#paper)**. It's the only deck I've used to play vintage since they were calling it Type 1. 

I believe the versions running [Mindbreak Trap](http://magiccards.info/query?q=Mindbreak+Trap&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) is the way to go, but I could be wrong. 

Despite having played the deck before, I still only own a single [Bazaar of Baghdad](http://magiccards.info/vma/en/294.html) and would borrow the rest. If I choose to build it up, it'll be a little while before I can get more.

---------------------------------------------------

I'd love to know what you all think! Apologies for the length of the post.
",Vintage
154,"I have been out of the Vintage loop for about five years, and have come back to find one of my favorite decks, Steel City Vault, has been extremely marginalized by current aggro heavy strategies. This makes me sad for a couple of reasons.

1) SCV is a perfect ""big blue"" showcase to get friends and others interested in vintage, and is bonkers fun to play. Especially in the pre Thirst unrestriction where it played flashy spells like Gifts and Fact, even Windfall, it felt like one hilarious haymaker after another into giant tinker/key vault wins. Now with emphasis on Opal, thoughtcast and Thirst a la old school Slaver, the deck feels Much more grindy and midrange (at least as much as Any Vintage strat feels slow) as you plunk out Seat of the Synod and reach to draw2 into your combo. It also Really sucks vs Null Rod with no nod to fragmentize or the OG removal like Ancient Grudge. SCV was the poster child in many ways for ludicrous, degenerate combos. Which, let's face it, is half the fun of vintage. 

2) At a more visceral (and some might say prissy) level, Aggro strategies seem to be Really dominating vintage at the moment, which have a lot of power and technical demands to win, but the spell heavy meta game of a few years ago somehow felt more elegant and, well, magical. SCV is a balls-out combo deck with all of the control pieces you could ever ask for, like Jace, stacked up with Welder and draw 7's. It's like an Astin Martin, while decks like Mentor, Eldrazi and Car Shops have all the sex appeal of a Prius. Techy ? Yes. Gets you to the win? Yes. Does it get you laid the way you should be when you ramrod Memory Jar into Mind's Desire and go off with Will? No. no it doesn't. 

While attacking with creatures wins games, the degenerate, card abusing nature of vintage seems underserved by these decks somehow. Just like Stax relied (and in some flavors today still relies apparently) on understanding how to manipulate the stack in your opponent's upkeep, now Thought Knot just wins. SCV required careful piloting but enjoyed a lot of explosive plays, yet despite its desperate digging for key vault and tinkerbots, felt a lot more diverse than a lot of strategies in execution (except maybe the null rod decks of the same era, alas Trygon Predator, flap on little buddy).

So that said, is the current affinity-esque version the best one? Is there a place for highly splashy blue combo/control that isn't Oath? Is this no country for old men?? 

If SCV is dead, is there another blue strategy that stands out for sheer power and brash plays? Just wondering.",Vintage
155,"I actually do not play vintage, legacy or commander and I happened upon this guy and saw the price was pretty decently high. I play modern and have no practical use for it, but given my no-knowledge of vintage or legacy; is he way over priced?",Vintage
156,"I was finally able to play in another vintage daily event on MTGO and of course I played Merfolk. I cashed out at 3-1, putting my overall performance in dailies with the deck at 11-5 so far (I've gone 3-1, 3-1, 2-2, and 3-1). Merfolk still seems to be a solid choice in the shifting meta, though admittedly it still has a bad Mentor matchup and probably a worse MUD matchup with the recent inclusion of Walking Ballista. The great thing about Merfolk, though, is that even though it doesn't do anything broken to cheese out free wins, it has enough mana denial, counterspells, and threats to have a chance in any match. It's very consistent and well-rounded. Anyways, here's the rundown from Wednesday's daily:  
  
[Decklist - Click for Link](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/573735#online)  
  
4 Cavern of Souls  
4 Wasteland  
1 Strip Mine 
10 Island  
1 Black Lotus  
1 Mox Sapphire  
4 Mental Misstep  
4 Force of Will  
1 Flusterstorm  
1 Echoing Truth  
1 Dismember  
1 Ancestral Recall  
1 Time Walk  
3 Null Rod  
4 Cursecatcher  
4 Silvergill Adept  
4 Lord of Atlantis  
4 Master of the Pearl Trident  
4 True-Name Nemesis  
3 Phantasmal Image  
  
4 Grafdigger's Cage  
4 Hurkyl's Recall  
3 Dismember  
2 Tormod's Crypt  
1 Steel Sabotage  
1 Ghost Quarter  
  
These brief match summaries are from memory (from two nights ago), so there might be some errors. The actual matches can be found on my YouTube channel. The links are provided in the round titles.  
  
[R1: UW Landstill (2-1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8m--tk6jys)  
  
In game 1 I was able to establish a clock and force a Moat at the end of the game. I boarded out my Dismember and brought in the Ghost Quarter because I didn't think there was anything better. Game two I was able to build a board up but couldn't counter an eventual Moat. I scooped to go to game 3 a little earlier because I forgot about my Echoing Truth, so I still had an out. Game 3 I believe they got stuck on mana and I was able to play a lot of merfolk.
  
[R2: UWR Mentor (2-1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuVtfNED9xY)  
  
I don't remember the exact order of games, but I believe I lost one game from a somewhat awkward series of plays where I had no choice but to keep copying a lord with Phantasmal Images that could be targeted by his Jace, and he was able to get ahead while I couldn't pressure him. Another game I was able to win by establishing a clock and Dismembering a mentor, and I think he was stuck on mana the other game, possibly helped along by Wastelands/Strip Mine. With Mentor being such a bad matchup, it's nice to have a little luck on your side.
  
[R3: Saheeli Oath (0-2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq1WGe_R8ys)  
  
Both games I lost to an early Oath of Druids that I couldn't counter. If they would have been on Griselbrand then I had the potential to Phantasmal Image the Griselbrand on my next turn, but they were on Sun Titan/Saheeli instead and killed me on the spot. Game two I had a Grafdigger's Cage with Misstep backup if they had Misstep, but they had the Force of Will instead.  
  
[R4: UR Control (2-1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3d9sHJWTLk)  
  
I saw Lightning Bolts, Sudden Shocks, and Pyroblasts in this matchup, along with counterspells and Snapcaster, making it a bit of grind. I made some play errors but was still able to win out. Game one I lost to a Pyromancer I couldn't beat. Dismembers out of the sideboard did a lot of work games 2 and 3, and True-Name Nemesis was the real all-star, avoiding loads of removal and bypassing blockers. Game 3 came down to the wire with the opponent presenting lethal if they could find any burn spell, however after a few minutes of cantripping they had to leave me at 1 or 2 and pass the turn, unable to block TNN.

165,"As you probably know, there were Vintage sides at GP Louisville this past weekend. SCG was awesome and put 2 of them on the schedule each day (Fri - Sun) and as a result, Vintage players came out to play.

As for attendance, here's how the 6 events broke down:

* Fri AM: 28

* Fri PM: 22

* Sat AM: 12

* Sat PM: **35**

* Sun AM: 28

* Sun PM: 15

The low numbers for Saturday AM and Sunday PM make total sense. The first is during the main event, which is going to syphon players. The second started at 4pm and players that weren't still in the GP were starting to leave in fairly large numbers. 

The events were all regular REL, which means no decklists and thus no well-documented meta. With that said, there was a little bit of everything represented. From just what I remember seeing (so I'm definitely going to miss some stuff), there were a few different types of shops, some different mentor builds, standstill, delver, oath, TWO 2-card monty players, even a nic fit player and dredge. Lots of dredge.

That said, I don't think it's too uncommon to have dredge be a bit overrepresented in some of these smaller events.

If you're reading this, you know that 3 days of Vintage is awesome and good times were had by all. As expected from this community, everyone had a lot of fun and remained in great spirits even while being savagely destroyed by restricted cards.

Would happily run this back even with it being in Louisville with single-digit temps at times.

Hoping that CFB sees the strong Vintage turnout and gives us a nice density of Vintage events for GP Vegas. ",Vintage

171,I am relatively new to Vintage and am curious as to why Skullclamp does not see more play. I mostly have experience with legacy/modern and I think it's safe to say that Skullclamp would never be unbanned in those formats.

172,Right now I am playing powerless shops/stax. How well is this positioned in the current vintage meta?,Vintage
173,"Vintage has a reputation for being highly competitive and extremely fast paced. I mostly play Magic casually, and my friends and I like to stick to the modern format because of the large pool of cards and, at least compared to legacy and vintage, more affordable cost. 

However, I'm curious to put together a couple of vintage decks. To keep this easy, just suppose that I have the power 9 to spare for both decks, dual lands for both decks, and the appropriate fetch lands to accompany those. These seem to me to be the bare basics of vintage staples. 

Would a deck archetype like 8-Rack w/ Liliana of the Veil for instance be tenable in vintage given the staple cards, or would this kind of deck be ""too slow"" in vintage? There's such a wealth of information out there on vintage that I can't really make much sense of it. Since vintage is considered such a highly competitive format there's not really any good ""Vintage deck construction for beginners"" articles other than ones that just point to a small handful of deck archetypes and say build one of those. Is there not as much room for creativity in vintage?

I have a class project for my degree program, where I have to make a full length podcast to turn in. Seeing as the topic is irrelevant to my professor, I might as well make it about something I care about which is MTG, specifically the Vintage and Legacy formats. If the first podcast goes well, I could see this as something that I would be willing to continue, given the support is there. 

As Vintage is a format that does not update very often, it would be difficult to have a podcast that is both regular and not just regurgitating the same material every two weeks. I feel the inclusion of Legacy would help keep the content fresh, while still pertaining to the target audience, you guys. 

My question is this, would any of you guys be interested in a podcast that covers vintage/legacy as a format, potential cards from newer sets that could make a splash, and tournament reviews? 

Or, alternatively, if you were to design a podcast yourself, what would you want to see in it?

I look forward to everyone's input.

181,"Hi, my hubby got me a black lotus as a present but is waiting to get me the moxen. Is there a deck, without proxying, that I could play with just a lotus? I thought of the null rod eldrazi list and if its not in my opening hand it wouldn't matter anyways? Or is that just dumb?",Vintage
182,"There's an sanctioned Vintage event in a month that I was hoping to attend, I was wondering what the best competitive option available to me was given my cardpool. I've played a some Vintage online but am by no means an expert on the format. 

I can borrow cards but borrowing other vintage staples is probably out as they'll be in other decks. Stuff like flusterstorms, mentors should be easy enough if I need them. Would like to keep borrowing to a minimum if possible however. 

I own:                  
-Black Lotus                             
-Ancestral Recall                               
-NOT moxen, other power                 
-NOT bazaar             
-NOT workshop              
-Duals/Fetches/Wastes              
-Goyfs/Bobs/most creatures             
-Thoughtseizes, Inquisitions, Liliana, random black stuff           
-Forces, Jaces, random blue stuff           
-LED, rituals, mana crypt         

Workshop and Dredge are out, and I don't own any of the random white creatures in hatebears (or cavern) and can't get excited about playing the deck either.  I've been playing Gush Storm/Doomsday online, but I don't think those decks function properly without moxen. How well do decks like BUG function without moxen? Should I just replace them with lands?

# Round 1
Dredge! Game 1, got dredged. I guess that’s how it goes. Game two, sided in 4x Cages, 4x Leyline Of The Void. Took out 3x Dismember, 4x Null Rods and 1x Metamorph. Not sure how correct that is, but felt okay. Game 2 Kept a hand with a Cage in it, played it turn one. His T1, it got claimed. Didn’t see another hate card in the next 4 odd turns. After the game, he mentioned he had two answers to artifacts or enchantments in his opener. Oof. But lessons learned! Mull to more hate. 

Match: 0-2
Overall: 0 Points.
# Round 2
Bye. Boring. 
Overall: 3 Points. 
# Round 3
JacoDrazi Mirror! I guess now that there is a ‘budget’ deck that’s totally playable, I should expect to face it more. I had asked on the Mana Drain about the mirror – most said I wouldn’t see it so I didn’t worry too much before the event. Game 1 he’s on the play and he powers out a Null Rod T1 from a Tomb. Great news for me! I slammed a creature or two and won the damage race. I suspect he kept a hand that was better against anything that wasn’t the mirror. 

I boarded out 3x Null Rods, brought in 2x Spacial Contortion and a Warping Wail. I did feel like I should have a fourth thing to board in, but sadly didn’t.

Game 2 my opponent got out an early Thought-Knot, but had very few lands. I had a handful of strip effects and a few Mimics. Played out the Mimics off a Temple and stipped/GQ’d his lands, he didn’t draw more. I drew into Reality Smasher and got there.  After the game I asked my opponent about his board. Apparently he’d strayed a bit from the Jaco list and only had a Dismember to board in, leaving three dead Rods.

Match: 2-0.
Overall: 6 Points.
#Round 4
White Eldrazi, played by a mate no less. One game (not sure which) I was on the play and had a Rod and won. Another, I was on the draw and he powered out and Endless One for 7 (something I cannot really deal with) and some Thorn/Thalia effects the following turns. Another, I was on the play and should have mulled to Null Rod, but didn’t (my hand looked fast) – I lost to the mana rock and moxen nuts. I didn’t really have anything much to board in with the exception of another warping wail (that I felt was bad due to thorn stuff) so I ended up not boarding anything.

Interestingly, we played a few more games after and I ended up winning 3 of 5 games. I think the Tribal list is better suited in this ‘Mirror’.  

Match: 1-2 
Overall: 6 Points. 
#Round 5
My Round 5 opponent was someone I had playtested with in the days leading up to the GP. I knew he was on Blue Angels. I know GQ does nothing against him and I know he plays Moat (something I don’t have a real out to if it lands). Game 1, I go all in speed demon style and get there. I felt I had nothing much to board in, so I just ran it back. Game 2 I drew the nuts again. T1 Rod really shut him off mana for long enough for my Mimics and Endless Ones to team up and do work. He tapped out for a Jace when I had lethal in the form of a Reality Smasher in my hand. I’d beat the race to Moat! 

Match: 2-0
Overall: 9 points. 

6th place. 

# Conclusion
I had a great time! What an exciting format. In spite of the fact that the deck was nothing like the style I play in Legacy, Highlander or event Modern I felt okay playing it. I look forward to your feedback on my choices and also, the next time I can play paper Vintage!

195,"Hey Everyone,

I recently have been looking more and more into Vintage and decided to take the jump. I play a lot of Legacy with a little modern thrown in there but Vintage has always been the ""really scary epic format that I cant afford"". 

I wanted to get into it but I wanted to know where to start. First off let me just tell you that I wont be able to get my hands on any power 9 for a bit, i had 2 pieces but my older brother is borrowing them as he plays a lot of Vintage. 

Can you get into Vintage and still have fun without having power 9? Besides proxying I would like to explore the non power 9 desk of Vintage. I dont ever plan on attempting to win big tournaments or anything but I want to get my feet wet with this great format. Any advice would be awesome!

For anyone curious I play the following decks within Legacy: 

Belcher (a personal favorite)

Lands (R/G)

HexDepths

Hypergensis 

Turbofog (yea I know wtf)

Stax 

Goblins

I like combos but also really like the staxs style of play. Any advice would be great, please be gentle with me as I am new and scared of Vintage.....

Happy Gathering :) 

Edit: Forgot to add Goblins, those little green men!",Vintage

I'm getting into vintage on MTGO, still figuring out which deck, leaning towards Delver, since I've been a fan of delver in all formats (except modern) since som/inn standard.

Compared to other blue decks it also seems to be the cheapest, especially with a few changes to the manabase (no tarns). 

I know mentor is the big deal right now, so my question is, is delver playable? Or is it the case that it can't compete in a mentor meta?

Also, besides this  sub, which other active forums, article websites would you recommend on Vintage?

232,"So I decided to put together a vintage list and since I play lands in legacy decided on a starting point of this list [here](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=10958&amp;d=262393&amp;f=VI). 

In this particular case I feel that sol ring is a good replacement for black lotus. It's reusable and can help power out a turn 2 Marit Lage. Granted Black lotus can do that, once, and can help cast a stand still/hexmage, it's a one of use in this list and doesn't seem as explosive/powerful as it is in other lists. 

I obviously don't have much experience in vintage and wouldn't mind a discussion on it. If I'm just crazy and this is a terrible idea, I guess that wouldn't surprise me, I feel like I'm undervaluing the card too much.

It might not be the greatest deck to start with but I knew from the start it was the deck I wanted to learn and get good at. If anybody has any good articles to read or any tips  or some videos to watch I would greatly appreciate it. I played a few matches and got wrecked by shops and mentor, but won a couple in the mirror. Even though vintage has a high learning curve I haven't had this much fun playing magic ever. ",Vintage
240,"Hi all, I'm relatively new to Vintage, but not new to Magic. I generally play some form of Burn in most formats, or failing that, red aggro.

I'd like to get into Vintage but looking through deck lists nothing really jumps out as something I'd enjoy based on my playstyle. Is there a way Burn is viable in Vintage? I imagine it would be something like Legacy burn?",Vintage
241,"So I got back into vintage after like a decade this Summer.  Was stuck between OmniOath and UR the answer.  Played UR the answer in a small event getting 5th in a cut to top 4. Sigh.  Then chalice got restricted (deck ran 4) and DTT the same which hurts omnioath.

I like to have multiple axis I can win on, so I like having planeswalkers like tez/jace + vault/key combo if possible or doing other stuff.

Part of me wanted to try out LSV's deck from a few months ago that had oath components in SB but it ran 2 DTT.  Last night I built grixis therapy with young pyro...but he just feels so much less powerful...I just have decided if costing 1 less makes that ok.  I only played a couple games with it so dunno yet.  It was fun casting a gush in response to a balance though :)

So for someone who basically wants to jam as many as his powerful cards in a deck as possible and hopefully have multiple ways to win what can survive in a sea of shops and mentors?

2:

I Have 23 pieces of power (not including an IE time walk haha) so I want to dump a few to recoup money from recent purchases.  I know I can get more once everyone's tax returns come in but still want to get them out there.

* 1 Black Lotus (Beta) BGS 7.5 with 2 8.5 subs include surface and nothing lower than 7 :)
* 1 Black Lotus (Unlimited played)
* 1 Time Vault (Beta) BGS 8.5 with 2 8.5, 2 9.0 :)

Library, tinker + blightsteel, vault + key, academy, yawgwill, and of course power (aside from twister). I'm also a fan of red stuff like pyromancer.

I'm kind of torn between playing TPS, some kind of monastery mentor deck, or maybe some form of an oath of druids deck.

I'm thinking about U/R delver since it only runs 5 pieces of power. Still the lotus will be tough to get so I'll probably go for that last. Is the deck viable without all 5?  Also there isn't a mono red stompy/blood moon style deck like there is in legacy is there?

I am trying tu rebuild my old Oath deck and when the choice of the oath target come i miserably fail to see the advantage of running griselbrand over Runescarred demon.

-oath RSD, fetch something to replay TW (noxious revival), swing with the 1st demon
-repeat

SO,
When comparing to GB, 
-You dont give your opponent another turn
-you dont care beeing jaced, swordtoplowsared, bounced, etc
-you dont care about your life total (i dont know you but for my part when i oath i already took a lot of dammage from many things, spirit tokens, delver, talia, golems, etc, preventing you to draw 7X2 or even once)
-you just cant loose when you oath wich can be different with GB depending of our lifetotal

In fact, draw7 (lands/mox/irrevelant things) leave me cold when i can have the right card i want and win on the spot (provided your opponent didnt draw an absurd set of counterspells during the ""oath turn"")

267,"Hi /r/MTGVintage. 

I’ve recently been messing with a pet deck of mine. I’m not a huge vintage guy, but a have a couple friends that are. I end up playing the format a couple times a month. So I could not tell you who is favored in the landstill vs delver matchup, but I know how to sequence my spheres :p

Anyway, I’ve had some success playing White Trash before. The deck played 4 Chalice 6 null rods 4 Thalia 4 leonin arbiter 4 waste 1 strip 2 ghost quarter. A rather robust LD package. I’d usually run most fair deck out of mana sources, the only real problem was I could not beat creature decks.

I had no easy answer for goyf, young pyro, and now mentor. STP and dismember out of a mono-white deck are eh, especially since they turn on counterspells that I otherwise dodge very well.

This time I’m trying out 0 null rods and a much more artifact heavy version. The 3 revokers and 3 relic-warders are there to pick up the slack of not having null rods. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rodless-white-trash-2/ As you can see the SFM package, the brimaz, and the spellskite are concessions to the creature + removal matchups. 

I realize that a) this is not a widely played deck b) D&amp;T decks always look like shit on paper so I’m not expecting a huge amount of insight about the deck. What I would like is some advice in terms of vintage-specific knowledge. For example:

Am I playing enough dredge hate? (3 main, 3 board)

Is 4 arbiter, 3 kataki + removal fine for the shops matchup?

Do I have enough fast mana to be able to have 2 mana on turn 1 consistently? I’m strongly considering playing 2 ESG instead of the STP in the main.

Are there any matchups that will probably be problematic for me? 

The Tabernacles are in the board for pyro and mentor. The 1-for-1 removal is there partially for that. Neither seem like good solutions, but besides SFM I don’t see any good answers. 

There isn't anything particular about the recent bannings that makes me want to play the deck, just that I realized that null rods are not mandatory.

Thanks for reading my wall of text :)

Edit: Did some testing mainboard against delver. The matchup seems VERY favorable. We played one particularly insane game where my opponent's library ended up &lt; 15 cards from the the gushes, dack +es, cantrips etc and I was down to 1 plains on the board. And I won that game.

Dredge was less good. Cages are out for a priest and RIPs. Not sure about the number. ",Vintage

[https://github.com/AdaptiveAutomaton/auriok-salvagers-black-lotus/releases](https://github.com/AdaptiveAutomaton/auriok-salvagers-black-lotus/releases)

Although it does make the combo much easier to execute on MTGO it still has some limitations. First, if your opponent plays a spell in the middle of the program executing the combo it will not work. It will handle lag and waiting for your opponent to pass priority though. Second, although the program automates the process it is not instantaneous, in my tests it's been able to produce 15-20 mana per minute.

I play LED Dredge in legacy and Loam-Pox in modern. They are probably my 2 favourite ways to play. Quick combo and grindy slow games. That being said I am not interested in vintage dredge. 

My favourite combo is anything with hermit Druid in it but I can't seem to find any recent lists involving hermit Druid and sutchered ghoul. I understand it falls to the same hate dredge falls too but I am thinking going BUG for missteps and abrupt decay and having access to ancestral gush and timewalk and trygon predator. 

If both of those ideas are total garbage or are just old dead archetypes that can't compete with vintage today I'll look into Oath or U-Belcher as watching both of those on VSL looked insane and exactly the kind of power level I'm craving.

I've begun the process of just grinding out a bunch of matches to see where my testing takes me, but after about 100 or so rounds I've decided to kind of lay out my thoughts to my fellow vintage enthusiasts and get your criticism/thoughts on where this idea can and can't go. :-D

Goals: Develop a list that that can be competitive in the vintage daily events on mtgo. 

Metagame: I strictly play on modo, so all my thoughts will be based around that.

Financial Restrictions: None. If the card is available on modo, I can get it eventually.

Historical Point: My deck takes its key from the initial lists ran by Chris Senhouse and Trey Van Cleave that were successful in a metagame that contained Academy, Tide, MUD, Draw-GO, and Oath to name a few. Somewhat similar to where the pillars of vintage seem to be today. Those decks were 4/5 color and had to play a lot of 5 color lands to get things going. With the advent of Sinew Sliver the deck no longer *HAS* to play green to get the beat stick potential muscle brings to the table.

Colors: My initial work has been on an Esper list, in order to include hibernation sliver to have some onboard tricks with FoW as well as act as Crystaline sliver 5-7. I Think there is a definite argument to be made for a Bant list to run muscle sliver in addition to sinew as a more aggressive list. Green just seems to have a lot less going for it in terms of sideboard potential. I want to hear that argument! :-D

Card Discussions:

Draw

1 Recall

1 Brainstorm

2 Dig

3 Preordain

1 Treasure Cruise

1 Time Walk

This seems fairly self explanatory. We're a tempo deck. I ripped this package from the VSL UR Delver lists which is possibly the best tempo deck in the format.

Counters

4 FoW

2 Misstep

2 Spell Pierce

I'm torn here, part of me wants to just go 4 Misstep and tap out to play my slivers every turn, but pierce is just sooo much stronger against a lot more of the field (shops/oath/tps). I only side them out when i'm playing against delver. I feel like i'm generally weakening myself against both by playing 2x2.

Removal

1 Path

1 Swords

This was 2 swords up until very recently when I decided that i'm seeing people play main deck ghost quarters to exploit crazy manabases, why shouldn't I play main deck path and not give the combo player eleventybillion life when kill their blightsteel.

Creatures

4 Crystaline - The heart of the deck. Blue, shroud and a 2/2 body. What more could you ask for?

2 Galerider - We need evasion, and for slivers, this seems to be the best. Kind of wimpy as a 1/1 and the only reason I have it as a 2of instead of a 3. Our draw package burns us through a huge part of our list as is, so we usually see them when we need too.

3 Hibernation - Crystaline sliver 5-7 except costs some life, which in in a tempo list seems like a pretty big cost. Also, against combo you can fake people out, play down to 1 card in hand and still be holding an active force of will. Its neat.

4 Sinew - the beat stick

2 Phantasmal Image - 2 drop that copies any of our team (hopefully a sinew for max value) and if there is a crystaline or hibernation on board, its downside no longer exists. Also, can get us a blightsteel, griselbrand, mentor, or pyromancer if we need it. 2 of since it can't be your only sliver in your opener or its dead.

Artifacts

1 lotus 

1 mox sapphire

3 null rod

4 wasteland

1 strip mine

Losing to shops sucks and we are a whole lot more likely to face it then dredge. Hopefully cut off the mana bases/wincons of the tempo/combo decks as splash damage. Fully embracing the vintage pillar null rod aggro.

Mana base: My fetch/dual ratios are really a guess. It seems we need white a lot more then we ever need black so that is why the 3/2 split on tundras to seas.

As for cavern, there is nothing sweeter then caverning in a crystaline sliver, it just blanks so many cards in the blue decks. I've seen a lot of ""meathooks"" lists run Aether vile in legacy and while it may be ok there it just seems extremely slow here in vintage, by at least a turn compared to cavern. There is the draw of being able to ""flash"" in dudes once you get the vial online and at 2 counters, but in order to run vile effectively we lose a lot of our plan of attack against shops. I'm definitely going test a list with viles, seeing as getting one in turn 1 blanks the taxes stacks is trying to impose

Sideboard:

2 Crucible - Shops, Delver (Wasteland Lock/Beat their lock)

1 Disenchant - Shops, Oath

1 Flusterstorm - TPS, Oath, anything blue

3 Cage - Dredge, Oath

1 Hurkyls - Shops

1 Illness in the ranks - Mentor, Pyromancer

1 Island - Shops, Anything I see a ghost quarter in

1 Path - Delver, Oath, Shops

1 Pithing Needle - Shops, Dredge, Oath

2 Thoughtseize - Anything blue. These slots feel like total place holders to me.

1 Tormods crypt - Dredge (I Like my dredge hate to be varied)

That is the deck. I'm totally open to any and all thoughts and feel free to snag the list and try it out for yourself. I'm not sure if this deck is ever going to have the strength that BUG fish and merfolk have, but I think it definitely has some potential seeing as its great great grandmother was successful in a format that bears a striking resemblance to today's contemporary vintage metagame.

297,"Spoiler season is upon us, and this card does two things relevant to Vintage for UU.

Displacement Wave XUU
Sorcery
Return each nonland permanent with CMC X or less to its owner's hand.

In Vintage it will probably only ever be cast with X equal to zero except in weird circumstances. The three main things it does:

- Acts as a weaker, but serviceable, alternative to [[Retract]] in decks that want to do silly things with Moxen and the storm count. Probably worth thinking about in any deck that runs [[Mox Opal]] and storm cards.
- Kills [[Monastery Mentor]]'s entire family, everything [[Young Pyromancer]] has ever loved, and un-flips and unsummons [[Delver of Secrets]], while also maybe buying you a turn against [[Oath of Druids] draws that tapped their [[Forbidden Orchard]] to cast the Oath.
- Pitch to [[Force of Will]] if required.

It has other fringe uses too - telling Merfolk or non-Gaddock Teeg hatebears where to go; killing the family of a [[Myr Battlesphere]] - but these won't happen often.

Importantly on the first use, while it does the same thing as [[Retract]] and costs 1 mana more, 1 mana spells are harder to resolve in Vintage than 2 mana spells. [[Hurkyl's Recall]] manages this effect at 2 mana as well but its other uses are good against different decks - Hurkyl's is strong against Shops, Displacement Wave is good against Delver.

I don't think this is the next [[Treasure Cruise]] or Monastery Mentor that will shake up Vintage, but I can see this card being a niche role player in the format.",Vintage

300,I'm planning on attending Eternal Weekend in August and would love to play in the vintage event.  I have no power or anything and merfolk is probably the most competitive deck I am close enough to having to rationalize building for the event.  What list do you think would be the most competitive with these restrictions?  I have Wastelands and Caverns and Forces and just about all the other money cards.

303,So I've got a Vintage tournament coming up at GP Utrecht and I made a Merfolk list because I really like fish. I haven't played a lot of matches with it because I don't have a lot of time before Sunday and I was wondering if I could run a one off Master of Waves. Probably not with all the shops running around but what do you guys think. Do you think that 4 mana is too much in a deck with only two power artifacts?,Vintage
304,"I have been testing Myth Realized since it was available on MTGO, and I have to say I have been successful to the extent that I play. I don't have time to play long tournaments, but can play various 1v1 matches, and so far the card is quite impressive. Now, I'm not trying to say that because I'm having success with it, the card/deck is inherently good, but that if me with my narrow and limited time can put together a fairly good deck around this card, then I would expect the experts to do so even better. However, when perusing winning lists, I don't see it at all. Anyone else testing it or have seen it played somewhere else?

306,"So the next Vintage Banned and Restricted List announcement is July 13 and I have been thinking about possible changes Wizards might make. Here are what I think could be possibilities, though I'm not saying all or any of them *will* happen. Restrictions: Dig Through Time, Chalice of the Void. Unrestrictions: Yawgmoth's Bargain, Flash, Library of Alexandria. I think Dig Through Time could get restricted because of how dominant it has made decks like Delver and Mentor and how it has pushed out previously common strategies like BUG Fish and Grixis. Chalice of the Void could get restricted because of how non-interactive it is, which is multiplied when it is dropped the first turn on the play, increasing the amount of variance and randomness in Vintage. I think Bargain could get unrestricted because it is arguable that Griselbrand is just a better card and it is generally much easier to cheat him into play with Oath vs. cheating Bargain in with Academy Rector. I think Flash could get unrestricted because nowadays it is more inconsistent since the restrictions of Brainstorm, Merchant Scroll and Ponder have taken place. Finally, I think Library could get unrestricted because it trades card advantage for lack of board presence, disruption and colored mana, though I am most skeptical about a Library unrestriction because I think that once it is turned on, the ability to drop a bunch of Moxen into play, especially when Libraries are in multiples, could be too powerful. What do you guys think? 



EDIT: For those curious, I have compiled data of archetypes, decks and cards in the Vintage metagame relevant to this discussion. 

* Archetypes over the last two months: aggro 51%, control 34%, combo 15%. (Note: This data is including Mentor decks as part of the control archetype. If you were to count it as an aggro deck, those numbers would be aggro 66%, control 19%, combo 15%.)

* Decks over the last two months: Shops 27%, Delver 14%, Mentor 15%.

* Cards over the last two months: Dig Through Time 52.1% with an average of 2.4 copies, Treasure Cruise 50.7% with an average of 1 copy, Chalice of the Void 29.6% with an average of 3.9 copies.

I'm heading down in a few months to an eternal weekend, mainly to play in the Legacy and Highlander but also the Vintage part.

309,"I feel like I have come to 2 basic philosophies. I'm not sure which one is better so I was hoping for opinions.

314,"One decision. Almost not a decision at all. 

Game one. On the play. URg Delver against an unknown opponent in the tournament practice room on MTGO. I mull a 7-card hand with a bunch of mana, some cheap counters, and no action. My opponent keeps 7 and I keep Volcanic, fetch, Gush, Flusterstorm, Misstep, Misstep.

It's turn one and I have exactly one decision--play the Volcanic or the fetch. I think about it for a second and make exactly the wrong decision. 

My deck has Delvers and Brainstorm and Ponder, I think. The fetch shuffle effect is a valuable resource, I think. If I need to Flusterstorm something, I'd have to crack the fetch and waste the effect. 

Waste. I probably should have thought about that word a little harder. 

So I play the Volcanic and lose the game. My opponent wastelands and I never get a second island to stick.

317,"Hey Vintage connoisseurs!

It's another one of these posts. I’m primarily a legacy player, but VSL has gotten me pretty hyped about Vintage, and there is a 15 proxy tournament coming up in my area in about a month. I would like to get started testing a deck, but I’m a little overwhelmed by deck choice. I think I’ve narrowed it down to either Mentor Control or a Shops variant (likely Martello). I play Miracles (Legendary) and Lands (RG Combo) in legacy, so I see myself as one part reactive control player and one part proactive prison/control player. Mentor and Shops aren’t exactly direct parallels, but they seem pretty close. Here are my concerns with both:

**Mentor Cons**

Reactive blue decks tend to require more in-depth format knowledge. I know the basics of vintage, but I think playing a blue deck opens me up for more potential misplays due to inexperience. 

Most of my testing will be on Cockatrice, where games are rare and 50% of the decks are bad homebrews (sorry), so I don’t know if I can get a comfortable number of games in.

**Mentor Pros**

Blue draw suite and card selection. Less reliance on the top of my deck. I hate variance. 

Alpha strikes with a 3-drop and his 3 token friends for 20 damage the turn after I played him.

More even matchups, less likely to get blown out by hate.

**Shops Cons**

Reliance on the top of my deck. I hate losing games to variance. 

Slightly more expensive to build, as I have fewer of the required cards. 

Not a huge fan of 80% win preboard 20% win post-board decks. That’s probably an exaggeration for Shops vs something like Dredge, but Vintage sideboards seem like a mix of anti-Dredge, Oath, and Shops. In a 6 round tournament I hate being paired against the 6 shmucks who loaded up on hate for my particular deck.

**Shops Pros**

More linear, pro-active gameplan. Doesn’t care quite as much what my opponent is doing. I’m being honest with myself, I’m no Vintage guru. Shops likely has less room for misplays (not saying the deck doesn’t have play, just probably less than a blue deck). More “free wins” after turn 1 workshop unanswered trinisphere, etc.  

I like prison strategies, and unlike Lands, Shops can actually play a hard denial plan. 

Lots of deck options. I’m leaning towards Martello Shops, as I think the generous proxy limit will dissuade people from running null rod decks.

What do you guys think? Which would you give a Vintage noob to take to a tournament? Which would you want to play long-term?

318,"Hey all, I'm an infrequent Vintage player (just the occasional Cockatrice game and my LGS' monthly Vintage FNM) and I'm wondering if there's some great secret of the format that I'm missing out on. Whenever I play Vintage, I find myself very frustrated with the ""swinginess"" of the format - one moment I'm running the board with an active Library and out of nowhere my opponent manages to turn the corner, counter a key spell, and suddenly I'm either dead or just too tilted to continue playing the game. I end up mad at myself for making a misplay and feeling like an idiot for letting a game go when I may have been in the lead. Even when I'm winning, most of the time, the victories feel shallow, especially if the win was enabled by having enough mana acceleration in my opening hand to do gross things very early. I feel like the ""broken-ness"" of the cards legal in the format will often overshadow the skill of their pilot, in short.

Is this a common problem? Will I just work through it? If anyone has experienced something similar, can you provide any tips to overcoming this seemingly massive road block I have to enjoying, what many consider to be, the best format in Magic?",Vintage

Martello-variant Mishra's Workshop deck.

You will notice the lack of the Lotus. The reason is that a Shops deck need permanent sources of mana, and unless Lotus is in your opening 7, it is a pretty bad topdeck. You play 4 better cards than it. They are called Mishra's Workshop.

I am considering testing 1of Mox Opal, and 1 of Expedition Map. Suggestions are welcome. The 6th Mox would take the Slot of the 4th Ancient Tomb.

322,"Recently, my local metagame has become infested with Show and Oath variants, and I've been having difficulties with the matchup.

Playing a Grixis Welder/Gifts deck (it's outdated, but I love it), I find myself able to win the Oath battle (Cages and Virulent Plague do work here) but having a very difficult time winning the SnT fights. Even after boarding in additional countermagic to go to 10 ways to counter it, I still find myself losing those battles. Playing against both of their proactive strategies while trying to assemble my own win through their hate (often maindeck in the form of Abrupt Decay) is proving to be very, very difficult.

327,"I want to start with a Power-less deck (as it's more likely I can afford it) and I was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction. 

First thing I'll say is, Dredge is not my cup of tea. I know people suggest that as a first build that is Power-less, but I've played Dredge is Legacy and I don't like it much. 

I play Miracles and have a pretty extensive collection so I should be able to build a solid deck minus the power. 

So do you guys have any suggestions as to what deck I can sleeve up and go play in some Vintage tournies and maybe win some Power that way? I want to hold my own against the established decks.",Vintage
328,"Hey guys,

I'm a fairly new player (around 4 years), I've been playing D&amp;T in Legacy competitively for around 12-14 months and really enjoying it.

I was wanting to move into Vintage, and was wanting to know if the deck can transition into a hatebears style (Maverick) vintage deck (if one exists).

With the inclusion of mox's and lotus and MUD being a well positioned deck in the format (atleast in my city), I feel a creature based, anti artifact deck could be the deck I go towards. 

Something like this http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/dee-and-tee/

This is just a very simple brew I've put together, complied of hatebears I've played in Modern and Legacy with success.

The one 'huh' card is probably Savage Summoning, it's my way of still being able to instant speed a creature onto the battlefield without being countered and without using vial (and thus, not being counter-productive with the maindeck Stony Silence, Null Rod and Kataki). 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I have no power for a reason (other than the above reason), being that the tournament I am starting to practise for, has a prize for the best placed non powered deck. 

Is the black splash for deathrite, DC and decay the best way to go? Is searching is a big part of the format, maybe even just a green white version with leonin arbiter (less / no DRS) and ghost quarters  (less/no fetches) is the way to go.

329,"Me and my buddy were playing vintage last friday (full proxy), we were both testing out new decks. I was trying bomberman gifts, he was playing merfolk with null rod. It was the first game. He wins the die roll. I kept a hand of force of will, dig through time, trinket mage, mox emerald, 2 polluted delta, and a swords to plowshares. I had mana and plenty of interaction. There were a lot of draws that made that hand very good. He played an island into ponder and passed. My draw step shows mox jet. I go for the turn one trinket mage off of tundra mox mox, it resolves. I reveal black lotus and put it into my hand, then pass. He plays an island and a lord of atlantis. I let it resolve, figuring I have swords and might draw out a true name nemesis. He passes. I draw mental misstep. seems like it could help. I swords his lord of Atlantis. He casts mental misstep, and I decide to misstep his misstep. It resolves and the lord is no more. I get in for two and pass. He plays wasteland and casts true name nemesis, into my force pitching dig through time. No counter force. He passes. I draw steel sabotage and get in for two again. He plays a cavern of souls and a null rod. I try to steel sabotage it, but it gets misstepped. uh oh. He wastelands my tundra, leaving me with an uncracked polluted delta and two mox. For the next few turns I get in with trinket mage, but fail to cast any of my spells. He fails to draw creatures. when he's around 7 life, he draws and casts true name nemesis. I draw-go for a few turns, he doesn't attack. after another turn, he plays a time walk he attacks for three, untaps and passes. We draw/go for a while, I eventually discard sphinx of the steel wind and unburial rites to hand size. My board has accumulated to a black lotus and 3 mox, and a polluted delta. after another few turns of this he plays silvergill adept for 5 mana, the mana drain in my hand does nothing. he starts to beat down with true name nemesis while leaving silvergill on blocking duty. It comes down to the last turn, I'm 2 life. Topdeck disenchant, throw it on the table targeting null rod and then fetch a basic plains. He forces pitching misstep, I force pitching misstep. The two spectators we had freak-out. I sac black lotus and tap my three mox for auriok salvagers, activate his ability, generate infinite mana with black lotus, cast gifts ungiven to get tasigur in the yard, unburial rites him, activate his ability 60 times and deck my opponent with ancestral recall. It was great, I love vintage.",Vintage
330,"Hey...I'm playing my first vintage event, having powered up (partly) over the past couple months...

332,Been thinking about getting into vintage on mtgo after watching the VSL each week. The format looks like a blast and would give me a chance to play magic more often than one legacy tournament a week. Would this deck be a good choice for the current meta online as well as a new vintage player? ,Vintage
333,"So, I was playing some vintage. As I am sure you can see, I play Martello Shops. 
He was on a BW Bob/Depths list.
G1 he wins the roll and I keep the following hand: Lodestone Golem, Emerald, Phyrexian Metamorph, Phyrexian Revoker, Wasteland, Sol Ring, Sphere of Resistance. 
I would really have loved a shop here to Slam down Golem on 1, but I can't complain about a Waste, Mox&gt;Ring&gt;Sphere effect. 

He mulls down a lot. Turns out, his opening hand was triple Depths &amp; no other mana, followed by all mana, then no mana again. I felt badly for him.

T1: He opens Thespian Stage&gt;Jet&gt;Bob.  I put him on Depths, and Am glad I kept a wasteland hand. I only have one MD answer for Marit Lage. 

I draw a 2ed wasteland. Play out my hand, Mox&gt;Ring&gt;Sphere. I leave Wasteland up. 
I considered dropping him to only the Jet, and looking back, I should have. I was more concerned with hitting an Urborg/Depths though. I probably was overvaluing my Wastes. The correct play would have been destroy the Stage, and next turn drop Revoker naming his Mox.

T2: He flips Thoughtseize off Bob and draws. He Thoughtseizes away my Golem. And battles for 2. 

I untap, draw my Waste number 3.  Play Waste, Revoker his Mox, and then Waste his Stage. Then ship the turn back to him. 

T3: He flips another Thoughtseize off the Bob. I am just glad it wasn't a fetch land. He draws and then ships the turn back.  

I untap and draw a Tanglewire.  Now this game is over. I play my 3rd wasteland, and windmill slam the Wire. He knows about my Metamorph, so he has 8 turns of tapping down, and dying to Bob and Revoker beats that he would have to fight through. He concedes.

SB:
Knowing that he is on the Marit Lage plan after seeing the Depths, I board in my 2 extra Duplicant, and an Ensnaring Bridge.  Which is the ""Last Ditch Effort"" effect from my Forgemaster.

I pull out a Sphere of Resistance, the Steel Hellkite, and a Chalice of the Void. If he wants to trade 1 for 1 out of my hand, I don't mind.  I just have to make sure to get fast mana to the Forgemaster. 

G2:
Opening hand in: Lotus, Sapphire, Wasteland, Mishra's Factory, Chalice of the Void, Sphere of Resistance, Thorn of Amethyst. 

I am thrilled with this hand. I saw Thoughtsieze in G1, and I have 2 Sphere effects and a Chalice as 1. Any one of those is turn one if he TSes away my Lotus.  If he opens into Bob again, I have Chalice followed by Sphere, or I can just leave up my lotus in play.  

T1: He cracks a Marsh Flats for a Scrubland. Duress. 
Looks at my hand for a good few minutes. There is no take that won't kneecap his turn 2. He proceeds to scoop.

His hand was D-Tutor, Pithing Needle, Bob, Diabolic Edict, and Thespia Stage.  
I don't think he had the smartest keep there. Against a deck that is a pile of Sphere effects, a hand full of 2 drops, 2 lands, and no moxen is not what you want. 

So that is the story of how I got my first Turn 0 win with Martello Shops. Thanks for reading!",Vintage

I am finishing up my cube in the next few months and want to start my building of a Vintage deck. My question lies in realistic prices. I have forces and duals so stuff like that isn't a problem. This really lies with power 9. I am working under the assumption that it will be about 7k or so if I am not picky on quality. Is this correct or should I budget more? My plan involves doing things over an extended period (1.5 ) years. Is this realistic? Thanks.

351,"So I decided to bite the bullet and start picking up Vintage pieces online. I already play multiple Legacy decks in paper, along with Modern, Commander, and Standard. Yeah, I have investments in pretty much all aspects of this hobby.

Anyhow, onto the main point of my post. I've always been a fan of Grixis colors and so I want to build one of the Grixis options in Vintage. Right now I'm narrowed down to either Grixis Control (something close to LSV and Bob Maher lists in the VSL) or a Grixis Delver list. Of these two, which would be the more viable list? I feel like a Delver focused list might be soft to more decks than Control would, but might be fast enough with some early game disruption that it could steal more games than I initially expect. Also, the decks are close enough that after I get the lands and Power purchased, it won't be terribly expensive to swap between them.

Any help is appreciated, in the meantime I'll be reading up on the format some more at the sideboard links! ",Vintage
352,"Ok, if you read this post in the last 4 hours, ignore it. I changed things around a few times, and finally got shit figured out. Basically, DagonGhola was out of town during the entire registration process, and Elanthus is actually just a moron. I didn't want anyone to miss out on the event, and I just happened to run into two local guys who are happy to play, so we can now have the original 16 player, 7 round event that we wanted. The odds of tiebreakers are higher, but it won't take 3 months now, at least. I got it set up so GoblinSettler and mini1337s are still playing round 1, and have already reported the match. If anyone (including GoblinSettler and mini1337) want to change their decklist, they are free to do so (just try to have it to me by Sunday if possible). Now that it's 7 rounds, we will switch lists after the first 3 rounds, then play with that list for the last 4 rounds, then the advancing players are allowed to submit new decklists for the top4. 

Sorry about switching everything around on you guys, especially last minute like this, but at least everyone who wants to play, gets to play, and we have the original 16 people that we wanted. Having 16 means we can do two groups, and the top two players in each group advance (the groups were randomized, other than Mini and GoblinSettler being intentionally paired).

If you didn't do either, you're probably not playing, so don't worry about it.

i used binarybeast to organize the brackets, which is a little unnecessarily complex for our purposes, but everything is on one page, including all of the round robin matches and standings. It will also automatically cut to the top 4 for us, though I'm not sure what it'll do in the case of draws. If, say, 4th and 5th place have the same record after 11 rounds, don't worry about it, we'll just ignore the bracket and play a tiebreaker.

[Here's](http://binarybeast.com/x1411034) the link to the brackets for each week. If your Reddit and MTGO handles are different, the name in parentheses is the MTGO handle. I'd suggest just friending everyone right now and getting it over with.

To make sure everyone has plenty of time to organize and play their matches, we're going to start matches this Friday, November 7th. Everyone has from Friday until the following Sunday to play and report their match, so 9 days total. I figure having two weekends to play each match should allow for the greatest flexibility.

Other than that, have fun, and make sure to give Sam your tickets by Friday!

Whilst I don't play eternal magic much, outside of casual proxy play with friends, I love watching it. Unfortunately a lot of content I enjoy has dried up - watched all the VSL, gone through SCG's back catalog and have seen most of the old classic content.

I find a lot of the real life videos hard to watch due to camera angles/language barriers and am generally more interested in things from a player's POV.

As such, I'm fiending for more and fresher content - could folks advise?

I'm especially interested in more niche decks - stuff like Mountains Win Again, MUC, UGx Madness, White Trash and Uxx Landstill. I also love me some Mayor Fish.

360,"Alright, so Lucas has sold out of MTGO and is no longer interested in running the League. I've decided to do it, as I'm already starting up a local League with a similar format. I'd like to get this started sooner rather than later, so I'm going to put a date on it now. 

**Structure:**

We currently have 15 confirmed players, and I'm lining up a 16th right now. If we get 16, we can have two groups of 8, where each player plays every other player in his group over 7 weeks. Everyone will be allowed to change their decklist one time after the 4th round. After the group stage, the top two records in each group will play off in a 4 person bracket. 

**Prizes:** Prize support will probably go to the top 4. If everyone finds 10 ticket entry agreeable, the total prize payout will be 160 tickets, plus my Jitte and Badlands. For approximation purposes, lets say the Jitte is worth 40 tickets and the Badlands is worth 50 (it's well-loved), so 250 total.

1st: 105 tickets

2nd: 65 tickets

3rd/4th: 40 tickets

This may be altered based on any suggestions you guys have, or if we get any more last-minute participants.

**Registration:**

By November 2nd, I'd like to get everyone's info down, and we'll start matches sometime the following week. Email your MTGO info, Reddit handle, and initial decklist to me at MTGOvintageleague@gmail.com. As for tickets, I'm going to try contacting Menendian to see if he'd be willing to hold them. Otherwise, I suppose I could. At least 1-2 of you know who I am, that could be enough as far as trustworthiness goes.

**Matches:**

A lot of the organization is going to be on you guys. You'll know who you're going to be playing each week throughout all 7 weeks, as indicated by the schedule I'll release. I'd recommend trying to plan at least a bit in advance with your opponent. It's probably easiest to coordinate if everyone has access to both the email address/Reddit handle of everyone else, so if anyone has an issue with this being public knowledge/it breaks some Reddit rule that I don't know about, let me know. I won't post your email address publicly, it'll be in a PM or an email.

Matches will be first to 2 games, 50 minute time limit. Winner reports their match to the above email address I posted with a screenshot of the win as verification. If I don't receive some sort of indication on who won a match by the end of the week, both players will receive a loss.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or know anyone who's interested in joining the League, let me know. I'll give an update on the ticket situation as soon as Mendendian gets back to me. The current list of players I've got is:

* willaeon

* DragonGhola

* mini1337s

* x1a4

* UnsealedMTG

* greghatch

* thecravenone

* R_Targaryen

* boxian

362,"Hello! 

Faeries is one of my favorite tribes and I really want to make it work in vintage. I realize that vintage is a completely different format from legacy so I'd have to approach the deck differently. At first, I tried to go tempo Faeries. Faeries has always been good as a tempo deck. With mana denial from Wasteland and Stripmine along with counters and card advantage like Spellstutter Sprite and Bitterblossom, I drafted a rough list. However, I realized that by trying to go tempo, Faeries was just a bad Merfolk deck. I went back to the drawing board and thought about trying to go control. After testing different color combinations, I came to the conclusion that UB was my favorite color choice. I drafted 2 deck ideas.

The first deck I drafted was this a sort of controlish toolboxy Faeries deck that can overwhelm with Faeries or win with a combo tutored up with the many tutors.

http://deckstats.net/deck-5159356-372b0505b945e67adf74ec8c68745226.html

The second is more of a standstill deck that abuses bitterblossom and manlands.

Because we have more than 10 people and I think 10 weeks of round robin would be a bit unruly, here's what I propose for structure: two brackets, with each doing round robin for 6-7 weeks and the winners of each bracket squaring off in the last week for the championship.  I'm certainly open to other suggestions, though.  
  
As for deck lists, I think we should follow the VSL model and publicly post all decklists after the first week's matches have concluded.  
  
For prizes, maybe we could each chip in a certain amount of tickets, and then have something like 2/3 to the winner and 1/3 to second place?  This will probably be logistically tricky, because who will hold all the tickets?  I'm fine with doing it because I trust me but what reason do any of you have to trust me?  Let's get some ideas going on this.

Really an interesting week, with its fair share of hopelessly lopsided games and more than a couple amazing ones. 

LSV was able to knock Stephen Menendian off his undefeated streak, tieing him for first, while Bob Maher picked up his first win at the expense of Josh Utter-Layton, leaving them both at the back of the pack. This leaves an interesting situation where we have, going into the final three weeks:

I'm trying to decide between a few decks. [White Trash](http://tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=14217&amp;iddeck=104759) or [Junk Hatebears](http://tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=13063&amp;iddeck=95890) seem like the lowest-hanging fruit to me. But I am a little worried about the potential presence of BUG fish and workshops in the meta. It seems those decks are becoming more popular and I don't like the way those decks match up there. If the meta is going to be mostly blue control/combo decks, I'd be more confident in picking one of them — especially if cards like Dig Through Time or Treasure Cruise are being widely used.  
  
The other deck I'm curious about and have access to is [Dark Times](http://tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=13648&amp;iddeck=100261). It seems to me that this would be a better choice against fish decks (and with the addition of green for Decay and Deed have a little more game against shops) but I fear it's not disruptive enough to beat blue combo.  
  
Then again, all I really have to go off for vintage metagame knowledge is watching the Super League and other MTGO streams, and reading coverage of GenCon and the NYSE on Eternal Central.  
  
So I was just hoping for a little advice. What unpowered deck should I pick for the event?",Vintage

The Friday Daily has a bunch of results, and 5 rounds, apparently. Arex1337 has taken a page out of Jugeia's book and stuck a full 4 Phyrexian Metamorphs/Revokers into his Shops list, though he avoids playing a true Stax list, choosing to play the full suite of Sphere effects and a few Sculpting Steels as well. His choices resulted in two finishes in this week's Dailies. 

Quite a bit of BUG Fish again this week - only 1 list with Edric, which reflects the trend that's been going with BUG lists for quite awhile. Once a fairly popular guy, he seems to have been pretty solidly replaced by Confidant once the archetype strayed into black. 

Other than that, just a few Dredge and Grixis lists made X-1 or better. Not much of interest this week. Looks like it's time to put together Humans online and crush some Dailies, just so I have something to talk about.",Vintage
379,"Some of my friends wanted me to play vintage with them. I play a lot of Legacy, but was never interested in any of the decks in vintage for one reason or another.

People were meeting up tonight so I slapped this together to jam some games. Not a whole lot of thought was put into the choices. 

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/10-09-14-ZWx-maverick/

I ended up 2-1ing workshops (metalworkers and forgemasters) and UB bob control and played to 3-1 or something against steel city vault (?). Which was pretty surprising.

I am sure this isn't the first time someone has thought to play thalia and teeg in vintage, but I can't find lists that look good. I'm not a fan of the black splash either, as the color doesn't seem to add much. (as an aside I'm a very emotional deck evaluator, partly because I am bad at explaining why I don't like some deck/strat and I've just learned to mostly trust my gut)

I feel pretty strongly about not wanting to cut CotV or Null Rod, as those cards cost me very little to play (few good 1cmc hatebears, not playing jitte) and do good things. The red splash also feels good so far and is probably important against the null rod decks. 

Minor annoyances with the deck:

Spirit of the Labyrinth screws over my Sylvan Library. I feel like I want to be playing both because spirit will do work against anything blue, and Library is the closest thing to card selection/advantage this null rod naya deck can have.

I'm playing 4 pieces of artifact acceleration and 8 cards that screw over artifact acceleration. Is it better at this point to be playing 5-6 spirit guides? 

All the good cards are legendary :(

teeg means I can't cast chalice or gsz

The mana is shit. I probably built it wrong. -2 red sources +2 fetches sounds better. 


Most of this stuff I will probably figure out on my own eventually but if any veteran(s) of the format can share some insight I'd totally appreciate it.

Only 3 Dailies this week, unfortunately. 7 Shops lists made 3-1 or better, including 4 from the Sunday Daily (which also had 2 Dredge finishes - bet that was a fun event to play in).

Surprisingly, there was only one BUG Fish deck this week in the vast swath of Workshops, and it was piloted by youhavenogame, who 3-1's or 4-0's every Daily he plays in anyways.

The 4c Young Pyro/Empty the Warrens Gush deck that LSV has been championing the last few weeks is still putting up some results here and there. Anyone around here with any experience with that deck? It always looked really clunky to me, but I've never actually tried the deck.",Vintage
382,"With two decently-sized paper events happening at Gencon recently, along with the conclusion of Vintage Champs on MTGO, this seemed like a good time to look at some data from the two metagames. I used the results from the two Gencon events (thanks Jaco!) and decklists from the Wizards site. The data isn't perfect, partially because the Wizards site sucks, and partially because Jaco and I classify decks somewhat differently (for example, I'm not sure if he classifies UWx Trinket/Clique/Magus/SCM control decks as Bomberman, or if it has to actually include the Bomberman combo).

Some info on how I organized the data:

- TPS includes all Storm variants that don't play Oath/Gush. 

- Jaco had a section of Archetypes called UW Stoneblade, so I assume his classification of Bomberman decks only included the actual Bomberman combo. I made a new Archetype called UWx Control to include all of the variants playing Angel, Trinket Mage, Clique, SCM, Stoneforge, but NOT Salvagers.

- Grixis Control includes the various Slaver and more dedicated Welder builds.

- I treated any deck that plays Tutors, Gush, Fastbond, Regrowth, and Storm cards as Gush Storm. Some lists are the more typical version with Tendrils, many were the LSV version with Pyromancer and Empty the Warrens, and one played Lotus Cobra.

- Rogue is basically anything I couldn't objectively place in any particular category, either because I didn't recognize it, or it was unique and wasn't really relevant to the metagame. This includes Dragon, High Tide, Rector-Omniscience, and some other miscellaneous stuff that doesn't fit in the overall format archetypes. I didn't include the Standard and Modern decks that showed up in the Champs Qualifiers results at all.

Cutting out the Rogue decks and categorizing them into loose archetypes:

Archetype | # at Gencon  | Metagame % | # at Champs |  Metagame % |
------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
Shops | 10 | 11.36% | 21 | 8.97%

Fish | 15 | 17.05% | 75 | 32.05%
Nonblue Aggro-Control | 6 | 6.82% | 14 | 5.98% 
Dredge | 3 | 3.67% | 20 | 8.55%
Dedicated Combo | 24 | 27.27% | 41 | 17.52%

Sample sizes are small, but there are still some very significant differences. One is the huge amount of Fish online. Between BUG, UR, RUG, and Merfolk, the tempo decks take up a good third of the metagame. This is likely due to the cost of the decks - in a paper tournament at Gencon, the price of most players' decks likely aren't a huge concern. Online, in an environment with a large number of new players; the cheapest, most powerful decks are likely to show up in droves. UR Pyro Gush, the cheapest of the 3 big tempo decks, has the largest difference in metagame percentage between the online and paper metagames. RUG Delver, a slightly more expensive deck, still shows a decent uptick in online play. BUG Fish, an absurdly expensive deck online, takes up slightly less of the online metagame than it's paper counterpart.

One thing that surprised me was the increase in Dredge players online. I've never used the V4 client, but I've heard the graveyard is exceptionally annoying to maneuver, particularly with large numbers of cards. However, with MTGO automatically announcing triggers, perhaps this disadvantage is largely unnoticeable. Or the appeal of a cheap, powerful deck is winning over a large number of players.

That's all I got for now, guys. I've never really done anything like this, so if you've got any suggestions, or would like to point out where I fucked things up, feel free.

Durward seems to have made his influence on the format this week, with two Survival lists going 3-1 (I don't think either one is him, pretty sure his handle is CalebD). There are also two lists running full sets of Night's Whisper - one Slaver list, and one Jace list. Two Gush Storm variants also put up results, one being the more traditional Tendrils variant, the other running Pyromancers and Empty the Warrens.

A lot of decks, pretty much everything came out of the woodwork. Interesting that they posted all of the results, including the 0-5 records.   The 3-2 or better lists all seem fairly standard, but there are some saucy failures, including Rector/Omniscience/Form of the Dragon, High Tide, a TPS list with a bunch of artifact lands, and one poor bastard who managed to sign up with his monored standard deck somehow.

Quite a bit of Gush across the events, including multiple Talrand Gush variants, and a bunch of BUG Fish. Oath continues to be on the downturn, with only 2 X-1 or better results, 3 X-2 results, and a bunch of X-4 or worse.

387,"I play forgemaster, and my meta has a sudden uptick in BUG and RUG players. As of now, I feel like it's a constant uphill, if not futile battle against these two decks, BUG, in particular. 

They generally pack main deck answers, like trygon, steel sabotage, decay, and various amount of null rods. Their high permanent count as well as DRS makes the mana denial plan much worse. In fact, their wastes and null rods have locked me out of game a few times. All in all, I don't feel like there's a shop variant that can handle it well. 

Normally, I'd go for Oath against creature decks. However, due to main deck decays, I'm not sure how it will do against them. I'm wondering if you guys have any idea as to what has a good match up against BUG or general strategies as to how to beat them. ",Vintage

I'm gonna start integrating paper tournaments into these posts. I'll stick to the big ones, but if there are any specific smaller ones you'd like to go over, just let me know.

Quite a few Big Blue variants running around this week, each with their own little tech-y cards. We've got Magus of the Future in some lists, Consecrated Sphinx, Welder + Strix, Sphinx of the Steel Wind, Notion Thief, Inkwell Leviathan, and even Pack Rat.

The impoverished community of nonblue players is still making a showing, though - a Goblins list and a White Trash list both got 3-1 results, along with the usual Dredge showing.

FINALLY someone 4-0'd with Doomsday. Good to know someone is still playing that deck.

I definitely want to see how much the online metagame is going to influence paper events in the next few months, now that we can see very clear metagame shifts online.",Vintage
390,"Well.. title says it. I'm not looking to drop 10k into like Moxen and Black Lotus, just want to screw around with some Kavu decks or something ridiculous. But I don't want to go out, drop 80 on a deck, and find out no one really plays Vintage in physical format. I'm considering just going to MTGO and playing there, because I know people at least play it, but I really prefer physical cards. Also, I'd like to know about the... I suppose ""competitive"" scene? Will this be something like SCG will host sometime, or is this just an online, friends sort of thing?

Sorry for the wall of text...",Vintage

Readinreverse went 3-1 with a sweet Pyro-Gush-Skullclamp storm deck with Burning Wish. I think I just found my favorite new Vintage deck. Also, the sweet 4 color humans deck has finally surfaced online, though this build isn't playing the 1-of Recruiter and Oath of Ghouls.

Metagame wise, there's quite a bit of RUG and BUG Fish running around, along with some straight UR Pyromancer. Waaaaaaay less Oath this week, not 100% sure why. ",Vintage
392,"We knew that we had enough to at least get an 8 man event going (what with Tim Stone handing out his 7 Vintage decks and whatnot), so we decided to announce a sanctioned, no entry fee, no prize support Vintage tournament, just so we could say we played sanctioned Vintage on the West Coast somewhere. We actually managed to get 15 players, including some guys rocking sweet old all Alpha/Beta decks (one guy dropped a turn 1 minty Beta Lotus to cast a Fungusaur). Maybe not the most competitive of events, but we had a lot of fun. I saw a Blightsteel get Cloned, then Boomeranged. There were some Force of Natures going the distance. Dante took it down with a BUG fish build, with me placing second with Oath. Not particularly important, just wanted to share!",Vintage

A couple of events didn't show up this week. I'm assuming 16 players didn't show up for the Dailies on those days?

Control Oath continues to show up in force. Ecobaronen seems to have tweaked his Grixis list to adjust for the amount of Oath running around, opting for two Spell Snare mainboard, which probably contributes to his success on Sunday.

We also have a sweet Sneak and Show port resulting in a 3-1 record: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/241807#online

We also have...Tribal Soldiers? What?

^^I'm ^^such ^^a ^^slacker

I've actually got work to do this morning, so I don't have much time to look at decklists. I'll check back later today and join any discussion.",Vintage
396,"Sorry for the shitty format, I tried to format it but I couldn't make it look properly.

List:

* 4 Mishra's Workshop
* 4 Ancient Tomb
* 4 Wasteland
* 3 Mishra's Factory
* 2 City of Traitors
* 1 Strip Mine
* 1 Tolarian Academy

* 4 Lodestone Golem
* 2 Karn, Silver Golem
* 2 Phyrexian Metamorph
* 3 Phyrexian Revoker

* 5 Mox
* 1 Mana Crypt
* 1 Black Lotus
* 1 Sol Ring
* 1 Trinisphere
* 4 Sphere of Resistance
* 3 Crucible of Worlds
* 4 Smokestack
* 4 Tangle Wire
* 2 Staff of Nin
* 4 Chalice of the Void

Side:

* 4 Grafdiggers Cage
* 3 Witchbane Orb
* 2 Maze of Ith
* 2 Wurmcoil Engine
* 1 Razormane Masticore
* 2 Ratchet Bomb
* 1 Phyrexian Revoker


 Match 1:
Mono Green Stompy
Game 1:
I already knew this player and his deck. Only thing my deck had to do was to drop a Chalice at one or resolve a Sphere effect. We roll the dice and it rolled in his favor. I kept a hand with 2 Workshops, 1 Trinisphere, 1 Sphere of Resistance, 1 Phyrexian Metamorph and 2 more lands. This was a keep because the game would be mine if. I dropped the Trinisphere. He opened with a Land Grant and a Root Maze so that I would be slowed down. He shipped the turn and I dropped my Mishra's Workshop. He then played a land and a Scavenging Ooze. I dropped a Trinisphere and shipped. There were a few turns of kicking with his Ooze and dropping Forest. I put down a few spheres and did not too much. He then played a Hidden Guerillas and shipped the turn. I had to play a creature now so because I would be kicked to death by his Scavenging Ooze so I played a Phyrexian Revoker. His Hidden Guerillas became a 5/3 beater and I had to copy it with my Phyrexian Metamorph. It came tapped into play because of the Root Maze so I had only two turns left. I passed the turn, he kicked with his creatures and shipped it. I played a land and passed. He then played Rancor and I died because of the extra power that Rancor generated. Shit, I had to win this matchup.

Game 2:
Sideboard:
In:
- 2 Maze of Ith
- 2 Ratchet Bomb
- 2 Wurmcoil Engine

Out:
- 2 Karn, Silver Golem (too slow and Wurmcoil is better)
- 3 Crucible of Worlds (he is playing 9 basic Forests)
- 1 Smokestack (just slow)

We both kept our first hand, I did it because I saw a Mishra's Workshop and a Chalice of the Void. This was a keeper. I dropped Chalice at one and that was game. I also dropped a few Sphere effects and locked him out of te game. This might work out alright now!

Game 3:
Same sideboard, same plan. I kept a 6 card hand with a turn one Chalice of the Void. I dropped a few Spheres and a Lodestone Golem and that was game. Succes! Let's go to round two.







Round 2:
Belcher 
Game 1:
I knew that I had to play against combo beforehand because I saw him playing round one. I also knew Belcher was an easy to disrupt deck if you play spheres so I would be in a good place. We rolled and I won the dice roll. I kept a hand with a Mox, Ancient Tomb, Mishra's Factory, P. Revoker, Lodestone Golem and double Chalice. This was a perfect hand against him. I opened with Mox, Tomb and drop double Chalice ot zero and one. He wouldn't have fast mana and all his rituals and cantrips were shutdown. He played Land Grant and showed his hand. He had kept a hand with Windfall, Vampiric Tutor, Burning Wish, Manamorphose, Rite of Flame, Yawgmoth's Will and Black Lotus.He then played the land and said go. I dropped a Revoker at Belcher and said go. He couldn't do much and the game was over when I dropped a Lodestone Golem. 

Game 2:
Sideboard
In:
1 Phyrexian Revoker (obvious against his wincons)
3 Witchbane Orb (obvious against his Belcher)

Out:
2 Karn, Silver Golem (too slow)
2 Crucible of Worlds (too slow)

I keep a hand with enough mana, Chalice of the Void, a sphere effect and Phyrexian Metamorph. He starts and drops Lion's Eye Diamond and Black Lotus. He then ships the turn and I drew a Phyrexian Revoker. I drop the Chalice at one and the Revoker at one. With a Sphere-effect and a Smokestack few turns later he scoops. 2-0! I made a slight mistake tho which I notice now while I'm writing this report. I also had to board 2 Ratchet Bombs against his Empty the Warrens tokens. Bit of a misplay but it turned out all right for me.


Round 3:
Storm with Bazaars
Game 1:
This was going to be another combo game. He played a wacky storm combo deck with 3 Bazaar of Baghdads. We talk a bit because we've seen each other before on other tournaments a few years earlier. We roll and I may begin. I kept a hand with a Workshop, a few mana artifacts, Tangle Wire, a Sphere and a Wasteland. This hand seems alright. I drop the Sphere and said go. He dropped a land and it was my turn. I then wasted his land and we did not much for a few turns. Then the action came back when I drew a Lodestone Golem. I dropped the Golem and the Tangle Wire in the same turn. I kept tapping his permanents with a Phyrexian Metamorph that copied my Tangle Wire. He died soon after.


Game 2:
Sideboard:
In:
3 Witchbane Orb (against Hurkyll's Recall and Tendrils)
1 Phyrexian Revoker (enough targets to hit)

Out:
2 Karn, Silver Golem (a tad slow)
1 Crucible (it's good but also a bit slow)
1 Phyrexian Metamorph (while it was good, I didn't think it's was better than the cards I had to board. Don't know if this was the right call)

He began and dropped a land, Mana Cryt, Black Lotus and Duress turn one. He saw a Wasteland, Sol Ring, double Chalice, Phyrexian Revoker, Witchbane Orb and a Sphere of Resistance. He chose the Sphere and said go. I was glad he didn't said Sol Ring because this was a tricky hand. I drop the Wasteland, Sol Ring and Chalice at zero. I dropped the Revoker at Black Lotus and said go. He then dropped a Bazaar and started with digging for answers against my deck. I drew another land and played the Chalice at 1 and another Revoker at Necropotence. I then started kicking him down. Next turn he didn't do much and I drew Tangle Wire. This sealed the deal and it was game. 


Round 4:
ANT
We both choosed to do an intentional draw and I went to get some food. I would have had to play against ANT so I wasn't really afraid of playing but it's always better to do an I.D. than playing and risking I would lose. I'm at 3-0-1 now and feeling confident about the top 4. There was atleast one combo player and another Shop player but I had Wurmcoil Engines in my sideboard where he didn't have them so I felt good if I got paired against Shops.


Round 5 (Top 4):
Mirror
Game 1: 
I did get paired against Shops. We rolled and he won. He then opened with Metalworker and albeit I did have a good hand I didn’t win. If only I had Revokers so that I could stop his Metalworker but no, I didn’t have them. He then started to drop threats faster than I could handle and I died after a few turns of blocking with Mishra's Factories. This really sucked for me because I didn't want to get kicked out of the top 4.






Game 2:
Sideboard:
In:
2 Wurmcoil Engine
2 Maze of Ith
1 Phyrexian Revoker
1 Razormane Masticore

Out: 
1 Trinisphere (he runs Workshops as well)
4 Chalice of the Void (he runs then as well, I’m on the draw and I can’t drop them turn 1, are not as good as in other match ups)
1 Smokestack (he plays them as well so 8 Stacks are a bit much)

My memory is getting a bit hazy after 5 rounds of playing so I don’t know my hand that I kept. We do a few turns not much interesting. Then a Smokestack enters play. He turns it up to 2 and he forces me to sacrifice enough permanents to leave me with only mana. He then drops a Razormane Masticore and I answer that with a Phyerxian Metamorph. He had to sacrifice his own Smokestack because he would be locked out of the game otherwise. We both have creatures now and he started attacking me. I kick him back because I have a Tangle Wire and he didn’t have that much permanents. I lock him out of the game with another Tangle Wire and I kick him to 0 with the Masticore.

Game 3: 
I left the sideboard the same. He plays a Metalworker and I drop a Phyrexian Revoker naming Metalworker. This turns out pretty okay because he had a mana light hand and I take the board over pretty quickly. I drop a Smokestack and this is too much for him. A few turns later he died with not much permanents on the board and not much life left either. And with that I entered the finals.


Round 6 (Finales):
Bomberman
Game 1: 
I heard other players saying that he was playing Bomberman. This was going to be the first (and only) blue based control deck that I would encounter that day. I kept a hand that had mana, a Revoker, a Chalice and a Smokestack. It was an okay hand. I had won the dice roll and dropped a Mox, Chalice and the Revoker. Revoker resolved and I named Jace, the Mindsculptor. This because I didn’t expect he would have the whole Auriok Salvagers combo in hand and I was more afraid of Jace which could get all the pieces for him. He then dropped 3 Moxes, a land, a Trinket Mage which fetched Black Lotus and he played the Auriok Salvagers. Well, that went wrong.. Thankfully he didn’t have any white mana so he still didn’t have infinite mana. I dropped Karn and Strip Mined his land. We didn’t do much the next turns, I only ate his Moxes and left him with two creatures on the board. A few turns later I resolved a Lodestone Golem and I took game 1. 


Game 2: 
Sideboard:

In:
2 Wurmcoil Engine (big and bad ass)
1 Revoker (for Jace and Auriok Salvagers)

Out: 
2 Phyrexian Metamorph (not as good as the cards that I’m boarding)
1 Karn, Silver Golem (not really usefull, he could go infinite before I could turn his Lotus into a creature)

It didn’t go very good for him and my deck did what I had to do. I wrecked his board with the Wasteland + Crucible of Worlds lock and Smokestack. Then I tried to resolve a Tangle Wire which got countered. This was fine by me because I could now play my Wurmcoil Engine next turn. He didn’t have any counters and with that card I won the tournament!



I was really happy with the way my deck worked. I only had a few iffy hands and I felt that I played most things correctly. I wasn’t too quick with playing my threats but wasn’t too slow and I fell in love with Shops again. There were a few cards in the deck like Staff of Nin which I played in these games but I don’t know anymore when I played them so I didn’t write about it in the report. I got 70$ of prize money and with that I bought a foil old layout Crucible of Worlds promo. I want to get a playset of them so this is a good start. I still have some store credit left but I don’t know what I’ll buy with that, I’ll see.

400,"Hi everyone,

It's been a long time ago since I played my last tournament in Vintage. That's why I want to learn how to SB against against various decks (mirror, Oath, Dredge, Fish decks and blue control decks). [This is my list](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/12-07-14-stax/) and I'll write my ideas about sideboarding against the aforementioned decks.


**Oath**

In:

2 Ratchet Bomb (destroy tokens or Oath/Time Vault)
1 Phyrexian Tower (destroys tokens that you get)
4 Grafdigger's Cage (stops Oath)
2 Maze of Ith (stops attacking Griselbrands and/or other creatures)
Graveyard removal depending on if it's combo oath with Wishes into Yawgmoth's Will (no graveyard no Will)

Out: 

2 Smokestack (too slow)
2 Crucible (too slow)
2 Karn (don't wanna have creatures that are kinda useless)

And eh yeah, what else? Or am I sideboarding too much cards?



**Mirror**

In:

2 Wurmcoil Engine (good with Smokestack and it's a solid creature)
1 Ghost Quarter (for Strip Mining their Shops and other lands)
1 Crucible of Worlds (against their Smokestack, for my/against their land destruction)


Out:

1 Trinisphere (they get around it with their Shops)
1 Smokestack (they run them as well, 8 Stacks is a bit much)
3 Revokers (only if they ain't running Metalworker or Forgemaster)
2 Sphere of Resistance (8 Spheres is a bit much)



**Fish**

In:

2 Ratchet Bomb (to destroy their critters)
2 Wurmcoil Engines (it's aggressive and it gives us life which they are trying to get to 0).

Out:

I've got no idea. Maybe 2 Karns?



**Dredge**

In: (this is so self explanatory that I'm not gonna explain why)

4 Grafdigger's Cage
1 Bojuka Bog
2 Tormod's Crypt
1 Ghost Quarter (against Bazaar)
Maybe 2 Ratchet Bomb against their tokens?
I could also board 1 Phyrexian Tower against their Bridges.

Out:

3 Crucible (way to slow)
4 Smokestack (way to slow and they have enough tokens to sacrifice)
2-4 Chalices (they're kinda useless because they get their tokens anyway, even if the spell doesn't resolve)



**Blue Control**

In:

2 Wurmcoil Engines (they have to counter it or they're pretty much dead)

Out:

2 Phyrexian Metamorph (I think it's maybe a bit over the top to use them).

MTGGoldfish was a little slow in uploading their data for Saturday's event, so I linked to the Mothership for that one. Apparently the Sunday Daily just doesn't exist, or it's too early on Monday for it to have been uploaded. Some names are still a little funny on MTGGoldfish - I'm working with the guy who made their algorithm to try to improve it. At least every other deck isn't named Gush Storm this time.

Anyways, general things I noticed:

- Control Oath is definitely putting up numbers. 7 3-1s and 1 4-0 across the week. RSD is showing no signs of life, though. People seem to have decided that Bargain on a stick is officially better than Tutor on a stick.

- MTGVector has taken the fun little value package of Welder + Baleful Strix and stuck it into a Keeper-style silver bullet package, which is pretty sweet. He went 4-0, too.

- Following up on /u/AGooglyDoogly's quest to get Grafdigger's Cage banned, I think [this](http://i.imgur.com/x20ygYR.png) says it all. When a card is so powerful that it's representative in 115% of decklists, it's probably too good. Wizards plz.

404,"Hi everyone,

I've been playing Vintage off and on for about five years. The last time when I stopped playing Vintage I played an aggro MUD-style deck. I  want to return to Shops now but I've heard that there are three different decks that use Shops. First off you've got the traditional ""I hate my opponent and I want to see him slowly die""-stax deck. Secondly we've got the aggro MUD deck and we have the Forgemaster combo deck. I've heard that the Forgemaster deck the same is as Martello shops, is this correct?

Well long story short, which deck has been putting up the best results lately and which deck do I want to use in which meta.

Just experimenting with some sort of weekly post like this - it probably won't normally be on Tuesdays, and I'm not sure if I want to keep linking to MTG Goldfish. They seem to have some sort of issue right now with deck names - so far I've seen Pyro Gush, Grisel Oath, Tezzerator, Keeper, Talrand Gush, and Gush Tendrils all under the name Gush Storm, which is rather confusing. I like their statistics and whatnot though, so I'll keep an eye on their Daily posts and see if they can get their shit together.

Anyways, some general things I've noticed:

- This is possibly due to the popularity of personalities like Reid Duke, but TPS seems to be making a comeback. 3 different players piloted TPS to a 3-1 or better victory this week, compared to only two Burning Oath finishes (both by the same player) and one Gush Tendrils. It's possible we'll see TPS become the go-to Vintage storm deck again.

- Shops continues to crush the opposition, with at least 1 pilot finishing in each Daily. This week, it posted the most 4-0 results of any deck.

- A port of the Legacy deck 12-Post seems to have made it's way to a 3-1 finish, which is pretty sweet. The list is here: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/238924\

- Probably largely due to the number of Shops decks in the Daily results, but Grafdigger's Cage is consistently in the top 3 played cards every day, despite usually being mitigated to the sideboard. This might explain the relatively low number of Dredge decks with 3-1 or better finishes (only 2 in the last week), despite Dredge being the most accessible deck online right now.

EDIT: I talked to a guy at MTGGoldfish - he said it was an issue with the deck-naming algorithm they used. I gave him some suggestions as to ways the algorithm can classify Vintage decks, so hopefully the results will be more readable next week.",Vintage
406,"What do you guys think? The card is opressive and shuts down Dredge/Oath/Storm really well and allows for MUD decks that are reasonably unaffected by cage to rule the format. It's seen as a 4 of in a lot of 75's - even in decks that have graveyard interaction run it to shut down dredge. 

I know that decks need good hate cards for dredge and oath but cage is a bit too good for 1 CMC.  Given that there is a lot of other cheap artifact graveyard hate that isn't quite as format warping as cage I think we could have a healthier format without it.

409,"Hello /r/MTGVintage

I’ve been looking to get into the format recently. I’m currently trying to find a deck that suits me. I’ve played a few games with workshops, I’ve tried white trash, and I’ve goldfished a few dredge and burning oath games. While I enjoy the decks none of them have really ‘clicked’ for me. 

I’ve been playing aggro loam in legacy for about a while now. I’m a huge fan of the deck. [here is my list](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/naya-loam-29-04-14-1/)  
* 	I get to play chalice, have it be completely one sided, and not feel bad if I don’t see any during a game. Unlike most legacy chalice decks.  
*	I get to play burning wish as a powerful tutor for bullets.   
*	I get to play life from the loam which is nigh uncountable and combines with card I already want to be using as a repeatable advantage engine and toolbox.  
*	The deck is toolboxy as fuck. Burning Wish,  knight of the reliquary, green sun zenith, life from the loam to some extent.  
*	I get to use wasteland away people’s mana bases.   
*	Mox Diamond.  
*	Thespian-Depths.  
*	I get to see lots of cards, and can make lots of important decisions.  
*	Mana screw doesn’t happen often in the 27 land deck, and mana flood doesn’t mean I’m not drawing live :)  

Depending on the matchup, I can either play prison control, midrange, chalice aggro, “combo”. or usually a mix of the above. 

If I can be doing the same kind of things in vintage as in legacy I would be pretty satisfied. 

While wasteland alone can win me games in legacy, I think the existence of artifact mana in vintage makes that a weaker plan.   
Chalice on 1 in legacy hoses delver and is live against most decks. I feel that I can’t get the card to be both relevant and one-sided in this format tho.  
Is punishing fire good enough to play? It doesn’t kill Jace, but is probably good against hate bears/bobs.  
Mox diamond gets splash hate in the form of null rod and such. Is it still worth playing it?  

Do you guys think that some kind of noble fish is what I should be playing?  
Vintage decks seem to have at least some amount of dyssynergy (bob+colossus, moxen + null rod,etc) I wonder how much I should want to avoid that (esp with chalice)  

It’d be cool to see some lists that match some of these criteria (I am too much of a noob to tell if a list is good or not when I see one in the wild)  

Thanks for the help",Vintage

(I think it's slightly different to the deck he played in the daily, he made some minor changes after)

The deck was awesome. The number one problem is simply you want a Bazaar so badly and your deck kind of falters without it. Good hands without Bazaar are usually hands that can stall long enough to draw one. Once you have the Bazaar though, the deck is INSANE.

This deck has so much countermagic, it just wants to stop all threats an opponent plays while getting incidental value from Madness with Wurm, Bloodghast or Rootwalla, get cards with Deep Analysis and just tempo your opponent out. I think most of the games Sam lost were to not having a Bazaar - this is a problem - but when he did have one, his opponents were just destroyed in the number of cards Sam was able to get on them.

There are probably things to change in this deck to make it better, but this is a relatively new and rough deck that can only be improved. I thought it was really impressive to see a deck like this attack and do reasonably well in Vintage and it's something I'm keen to try for myself.",Vintage
411,"Here's my tournament report for the NYSE Open II. I made the top 4 on a UW Angel Control list. I'll post my list and a discussion in the comments!

Rd 1: Dan Mason, on Goblins

Game 1: Did you know that Batterskull is mostly unbeatable for goblins?

Game 2: I mull to 5. Did you know that Moat is literally unbeatable for goblins?

Rd 2: Mastriano, with Keeper

Game 1: He goes for Vault Key, via tinker. I let Tinker resolve, and Disenchant Time Vault. Some turns later, he casts Yawg's Will with Force of Will backup, and we're off to game 2. I probably should have forced the Tinker!

Game 2: We have a drawn out game. He's burning me out with Deathrite Shaman (note: I boarded out Misstep for game 2—it's not good against most drain decks, but pretty good against Keeper), and I'm beating down with Restoration Angel. We have an involved turn where he decides to let Yawg's Will get countered, and casts Ponder. He bricks off Ponder, and Angels kill him.

Game 3: He has Sensei's top for a while, but is locked on lands, while I brainstorm lock myself to 3 lands with Forces and 4s. I Force everything he does, draw a fourth land before he does, and Restoration Angel+Fact or Fiction finishes the job. Probably got lucky I didn't draw awkward answers!

Rd 3: BUG Midrange/Control

Game 1: He plays Jace pretty early, but isn't doing much of relevance. I resolve a Fact or Fiction to keep up in cards, and set up a turn where I just start attacking him. I V-Clique him on a key turn after he's put Blightsteel into play, where he had Hurkyls in hand. He should have won on the spot here, by Hurkyl's-ing me in response, forcing me to play a blocker if I had one, then bouncing the blocker with his Jace (yeah, this game was bananas!) and killing me with the blightsteel through one toughness, but he misses the line. I let him try to find the line again by leaving Hurkyls in his hand. He fails to take the winning line, and dies on my crack-back.

Game 2: He plays Jace on 3, while I'm stuck on 2 sources. I force, he forces back, and I get fatesealed out of the game. Very academic, but very time consuming.

Game 3: I quickly establish a commanding board position, and am barely able to close out the game in turns.

Rd 4: Nick DiJohn, on Shops

Game 1: He plays extraordinarily well, finally setting up an unmolested forgemaster. Whoops, Swords right of the top, extend hand. Skill game.

Game 2: Game is over before it begins, we just don't know it. I have like 7 counterspells for his things, Stoneforge Mystic, and Jace. He dies.

Rd 5—some nobody from california :):

Game 1: My turn 1—recall myself, misdirection. Lotus, spell pierce. His turn 2—Lotus, Delver, Pyromancer, Mystical for Time Walk. I drew a card, and scooped.

Game 2: 2 Delvers into my hand of 4s kills me. Moat: not so effective against flipped delvers, though it is quite good against pyromancers and Goyfs (which Menendian didn't have—but I didn't know that).

Rd 6: Flash-Rector

I was pretty surprised to see this deck here. My inclination was that it was terrible...but yeah, it's not terrible, just inconsistent.

Game 1: He cast Cabal Therapy. Then casts Show and Tell to put Rector in to play with Force backup. Then Flashes back Cabal Therapy. I did not win that game.

Game 2: We both have fairly awkward draws. I keep a 2 lander with Library of Alexandria, and discard like 3 times before I can get the lands to come. The key turn was when rather than firing off toxic deluge to kill one Rector, and go from there my opponent goes for a second rector, and the instant win next turn with Toxic Deluge. I slam a sideboarded Rest in Peace in the interim, and his 1/2s are unable to finish the job against my deck full of creatures.

Game 3: He never really gets off the ground, as I stop his early threat with a Drain, and start bashing him with Sword of Feast and Famine—he is unable to build to a critical mass, and dies.

I did it!

Rd 7: Intentional Draw

Top 8: Joel Lim, on Merfolk

Game 1: His deck craps out on him. He has 2 Cursecatchers, but just a Recall for action. I force the recall, and my hand with Stoneforge Mystic, Swords, Swords, and this quickly puts him out of his misery when he draws three lands.

Game 2: Again, awkward draws, but he starts playing lords, and I die quickly thereafter. (Moat was the top card. Rats!)

Game 3: I channeled my inner Justin Kohler as hard as is possible. My turn 1: Karakas, Sapphire, Time Walk, Draw, Lotus, Fetchland, Jace, Force your Force. He doesn't cast Cursecatcher on his first turn.

Nope, didn't manage to screw that one up (I also had the most disgusting FoF of all time in there too. Sometimes you run good).

Top 4: Keith Seals, on Shops

Game 1: We have an awkward moment where he plays a Chalice 1 into his Chalice 2. I miss it, draw, and then a judge is called over. He gets his Chalice 1, and I'm unable to do anything as he kills me.

Game 2: He has a tangle wire draw, but I'm able to continually remove threats while still under the wire, since I've got instant speed removal. He finally sets up a forgemaster, and I'm unable to stop it from going active. He waits till my end step, fetches up Blightsteel, and promptly has it bounced back to his hand with Steel Sabotage off Snapcaster. I then cast Jace, and he concedes.

Game 3: He Revokers Stoneforge Mystic, and I lose stuck on 2 lands with a Mystic in play. Shops does that to you sometimes.

That said, I can win with the deck, but I'm usually playing Gushes for value to draw into counterspells with Talrand out. I'm playing this like a control deck almost 100% of the time, and never really going for the storm kill.

Welder Control: +1 works with Welder, -2 is strong in general.

I don't currently play Vintage and never have, but I'm moderately interested in getting into the format (even if it's just proxied).

For those of you that don't know what that is, there are 5 types of decks in vintage (these aren't necessarily archetypes, but any deck will probably fit in one of these categories):

Workshop Prison: Gets its name off of Mishra's Workshop, uses artifacts primarily creating a lockdown or just beats down with huge creatures

Mana Drain control: Gets its name off of Mana Drain, they play like a control deck (duh)

Ritual combo: Gets its name off of Dark Ritual, they play combo based off of ritual effects, usually a storm deck.

Null Rod aggro: Gets its name off of Null Rod, because most vintage decks rely on (or at least use) fast artifact mana, Null Rod shuts them down.

Bazaar of Baghdad based decks: This isn't very specific as to what type of deck it is, but they usually use Bazaar of Baghdad.

It has been pretty solid, however, it is very lacking in both the Oath matchups, and against TPS (two very popular decks right now). It also is just terrrrriiiibbbbllle against MUD. 

Grapeshot usually take the spot of lightning bolt, abrupt decay, or an ancient grudge. All 3 are very good against MUD. However, grapeshot can be very good against many other decks (let's say storm is 10, and you have a young pyromancer and a time walk. You just grapeshot your opponent, timewalk, and kill them). The card also makes way for your mancers, and gives many decks some reach (RUG Delver can get around 5 points of reach with grapeshot, and there is nothing a force of will can do about it, not to mention grapeshot has the potential to actually boardwhipe a suck-folk/merfolk opponent)",Vintage

Either that, or the deck plays a turn 1 kiln fiend, and then you die on turn 2 because I tutor up a fastbond and go to town with gush+regrowth.

As my meta lacks traditional mud variants that require the inclusion of Ingot chewer to defeat, I have tossed it from my sideboard in favor of more kiln fiends (against combo decks for a faster clock), abrupt decay, Trygon Predator (pesky pesky Oath!), and REB For those damn fish.
